## System Overview

### Vision
Transform B2B relationships from extractive data collection to ethical storyteller partnerships that create mutual value, respect community wisdom, and generate sustainable revenue for storytellers while achieving organizational goals.

### Core Principles
- **Storyteller-First Economics**: Storytellers receive majority value from organizational partnerships
- **Community Benefit Requirement**: All partnerships must demonstrate community benefit
- **Ethical Consent Management**: Robust consent and privacy protection systems
- **Cultural Protocol Respect**: Integration of cultural protocols and community wisdom traditions
- **Transparency & Accountability**: Clear reporting on partnership impacts and outcomes

### Organizational Partnership Evolution
```
FROM TRADITIONAL B2B → TO ETHICAL PARTNERSHIP
├── Traditional Approach
│   ├── Data extraction and analysis
│   ├── One-way value flow (organization benefits)
│   ├── Anonymous participant engagement
│   └── Limited community benefit or feedback
│
└── Empathy Ledger Approach
    ├── Story partnership and collaboration
    ├── Mutual value creation (storyteller & organization benefit)
    ├── Named storyteller relationships and ongoing partnerships
    └── Required community benefit and impact measurement
```
