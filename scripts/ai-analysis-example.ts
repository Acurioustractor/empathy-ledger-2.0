// Example storyteller transcript
const EXAMPLE_TRANSCRIPT = `
I never thought I'd be sitting here talking about mental health, you know? Growing up in my family, 
we just didn't talk about feelings. My dad was this strong, silent type, and my mom, she worried 
about everything but kept it all inside.

When I started having panic attacks in college, I thought I was going crazy. The first one happened 
during finals week. I was in the library, and suddenly I couldn't breathe. My heart was racing, 
and I felt like I was dying. I ran out of there so fast.

It took me three years to finally talk to someone. Three years of suffering in silence, thinking 
I was weak, thinking I was broken. The hardest part was realizing I didn't have to face it alone.

My therapist, Sarah, she changed everything. She helped me understand that anxiety isn't a character 
flaw - it's just part of being human. Some of us just feel things more intensely.

Recovery isn't linear, you know? There were setbacks, days when I felt like I was back at square one. 
But every small step matters. Learning to breathe through panic attacks, recognizing my triggers, 
building a support network - all of that added up.

Now I work as a peer counselor at the campus mental health center. I want other students to know 
they're not alone. When someone comes in having their first panic attack, I can sit with them and 
say, "I've been exactly where you are, and you're going to be okay."

The thing that surprised me most? How many people have similar stories. We all think we're the only 
ones struggling, but once you start talking, you realize how common these experiences are. That's 
both heartbreaking and comforting.

I still have anxiety. I probably always will. But now I have tools, I have community, I have purpose. 
Sharing my story helped me reclaim my narrative. Instead of being defined by my mental health challenges, 
I'm defined by how I've grown through them.

If there's one thing I want people to know, it's this: asking for help isn't giving up - it's fighting back.
