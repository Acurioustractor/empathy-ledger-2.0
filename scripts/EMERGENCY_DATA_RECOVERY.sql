-- =====================================================================
-- EMERGENCY DATA RECOVERY SCRIPT
-- This script is designed to recover data that may have been lost
-- during the migration process
-- =====================================================================

-- IMMEDIATE ACTIONS NEEDED:

-- 1. CHECK IF TABLES STILL EXIST
-- Run these queries to see what tables are still in your database:

SELECT table_name 
FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
ORDER BY table_name;

-- 2. CHECK IF DATA STILL EXISTS
-- If tables exist, check if data is still there:

-- For each table that should exist, run:
-- SELECT COUNT(*) FROM table_name;

-- 3. EMERGENCY BACKUP
-- If data exists, create immediate backups:

-- CREATE TABLE backup_profiles AS SELECT * FROM profiles;
-- CREATE TABLE backup_stories AS SELECT * FROM stories;
-- CREATE TABLE backup_users AS SELECT * FROM users;
-- CREATE TABLE backup_projects AS SELECT * FROM projects;
-- CREATE TABLE backup_project_members AS SELECT * FROM project_members;
-- CREATE TABLE backup_community_insights AS SELECT * FROM community_insights;
-- CREATE TABLE backup_content_calendar AS SELECT * FROM content_calendar;
-- CREATE TABLE backup_cross_project_connections AS SELECT * FROM cross_project_connections;
-- CREATE TABLE backup_platform_audit_log AS SELECT * FROM platform_audit_log;
-- CREATE TABLE backup_platform_modules AS SELECT * FROM platform_modules;
-- CREATE TABLE backup_project_analytics AS SELECT * FROM project_analytics;
-- CREATE TABLE backup_project_invitations AS SELECT * FROM project_invitations;
-- CREATE TABLE backup_project_modules AS SELECT * FROM project_modules;
-- CREATE TABLE backup_project_templates AS SELECT * FROM project_templates;
-- CREATE TABLE backup_story_analysis AS SELECT * FROM story_analysis;
-- CREATE TABLE backup_storyteller_connections AS SELECT * FROM storyteller_connections;
-- CREATE TABLE backup_value_events AS SELECT * FROM value_events;

-- 4. DATA EXPORT
-- Export all data to SQL files:

-- pg_dump --data-only --table=profiles your_database > profiles_backup.sql
-- pg_dump --data-only --table=stories your_database > stories_backup.sql
-- pg_dump --data-only --table=users your_database > users_backup.sql
-- etc.

-- 5. RECOVERY STEPS
-- If tables were dropped, we need to:
-- a) Restore from Supabase backups (if available)
-- b) Recreate tables from backup data
-- c) Restore data from backup tables

-- 6. PREVENT FURTHER DAMAGE
-- Stop all migrations until we confirm data safety
-- Do not run any more supabase db push commands
-- Do not run any more supabase db reset commands

-- =====================================================================
-- IMMEDIATE ACTION PLAN
-- =====================================================================

-- STEP 1: Check what's currently in the database
-- STEP 2: Create backups of any remaining data
-- STEP 3: Check Supabase dashboard for automatic backups
-- STEP 4: Restore data if needed
-- STEP 5: Fix the migration process to be non-destructive

-- =====================================================================
-- CONTACT SUPABASE SUPPORT
-- =====================================================================

-- If data is missing, immediately contact Supabase support:
-- 1. Go to your Supabase dashboard
-- 2. Check the "Backups" section
-- 3. Look for point-in-time recovery options
-- 4. Contact support for emergency data recovery

-- =====================================================================
-- PREVENTION FOR FUTURE
-- =====================================================================

-- 1. Always test migrations on development environment first
-- 2. Always create backups before running migrations
-- 3. Use non-destructive migrations (CREATE, ALTER, not DROP)
-- 4. Implement proper rollback procedures
-- 5. Use migration tools that preserve data

-- THIS IS AN EMERGENCY SITUATION - ACT IMMEDIATELY
