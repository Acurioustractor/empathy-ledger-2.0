const TEST_TRANSCRIPT = `
I never thought I'd be sharing my story like this, but here I am. Three years ago, 
I was diagnosed with anxiety and depression. At first, I felt so alone, like I was 
the only person in the world going through this.

The hardest part wasn't the panic attacks or the sleepless nights - it was the shame. 
I come from a family where mental health just wasn't talked about. My parents always 
said to "just think positive" or "others have it worse."

But you know what changed everything? Finding a support group at my local community center. 
For the first time, I met other people who really understood what I was going through. 
Sarah, our group facilitator, helped me realize that asking for help isn't giving up - 
it's actually incredibly brave.

Now I volunteer with that same support group. I want other people to know they're not alone. 
Recovery isn't linear - there are still hard days - but I've learned that it's okay to 
not be okay sometimes. What matters is that we keep showing up for ourselves and each other.

If I could tell my past self one thing, it would be: "Your story matters, and sharing it 
will not only help you heal, but it might just help someone else feel less alone too."
