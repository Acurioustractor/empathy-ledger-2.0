## üìß **Tier 1 Organization Outreach Emails**

### **Email 1: Cultural Survival**

**To:** Cultural Survival general contact + Indigenous Youth Fellowship coordinators
**Subject:** "Alternative to LinkedIn for Indigenous Professionals: Community-Owned Platform with Data Sovereignty"

```
Dear Cultural Survival Team,

I hope this message finds you well. My name is Ben Knight, and I'm writing from A Curious Tractor about work that I believe aligns deeply with Cultural Survival's commitment to Indigenous rights and community empowerment.

We're building Empathy Ledger as the storytelling-centered alternative to LinkedIn, designed specifically to address how traditional professional platforms extract value from Indigenous knowledge without community control or compensation.

**Connection to Cultural Survival's Work:**
Your Indigenous Youth Fellowship program represents exactly the kind of community leadership development that traditional professional networking fails to support. Young Indigenous leaders have profound expertise in cultural preservation, community organizing, and traditional knowledge‚Äîbut LinkedIn reduces this to job titles and skills lists that miss their real professional value.

**Why This Matters for Cultural Survival:**
When you're seeking staff, consultants, or grantee partners, traditional platforms show credentials but can't reveal who has:
- Authentic relationships with Indigenous communities and cultural protocol understanding
- Experience with community-controlled development and participatory decision-making
- Commitment to Indigenous sovereignty and decolonizing practices rather than just diversity checkbox completion
- Cultural competency developed through lived experience and community accountability

**Platform Design Aligned with Indigenous Values:**
- **Data Sovereignty:** Indigenous professionals own their content completely and control who accesses their knowledge
- **Community Governance:** Platform policies include Indigenous community participation rather than corporate control
- **Revenue Sharing:** 70% of platform income flows to content creators (storytellers) rather than shareholders
- **Cultural Protocols:** Design informed by Aboriginal relationship-building wisdom and respectful engagement practices

**Immediate Opportunity:**
We're launching a $1000 Storyteller Program with several Indigenous Youth Fellowship alumni and other Indigenous leaders to demonstrate how storytelling reveals authentic community expertise. Cultural Survival could:

- **Discover Indigenous professionals** through storytelling that reveals cultural competency and community relationships
- **Support Indigenous economic empowerment** through platform participation and revenue sharing
- **Connect with Indigenous Youth Fellows** and other culturally grounded professionals for organizational partnerships
- **Advance Indigenous data sovereignty** by participating in community-controlled professional networking

**Example Value:**
Rather than hiring "Indigenous Program Coordinator with relevant experience," you could connect with someone whose story demonstrates how they've maintained cultural protocols while navigating institutional spaces, built authentic relationships across tribal communities, and developed programming that strengthens rather than extracts from Indigenous communities.

**Next Steps:**
Would someone from Cultural Survival be interested in a 20-minute conversation about how storytelling-centered networking might serve your talent needs while supporting Indigenous professional development and data sovereignty?

You can learn more about our community-centered approach at acurioustractor.org and our commitment to Indigenous protocols at [community advisory documentation].

**We believe professional networking should strengthen Indigenous communities rather than extracting knowledge for corporate benefit.**

In solidarity and respect,

Ben Knight
Co-founder, A Curious Tractor
Creator, Empathy Ledger
ben@acurioustractor.org

P.S. All platform development includes ongoing consultation with Aboriginal community advisors who ensure our approach honors Indigenous protocols and creates genuine community benefit rather than appropriating cultural language.

### **Email 2: Climate Justice Alliance**

**To:** Climate Justice Alliance contact form + member organization networks
**Subject:** "Community-Owned Platform for Frontline Environmental Leaders: Alternative to Extractive Networking"

```
Dear Climate Justice Alliance,

I hope this message finds you in the struggle for climate justice. My name is Ben Knight, and I'm reaching out from A Curious Tractor about work that aligns with CJA's commitment to community-controlled Just Transition and frontline leadership.

Your network of 95+ frontline community organizations represents exactly the kind of grassroots environmental expertise that traditional professional platforms consistently undervalue and extract from without compensation.

**The Problem:**
When environmental organizations seek staff, consultants, or partners, LinkedIn shows job titles and degrees but can't reveal who has:
- Authentic relationships with frontline communities and environmental justice organizing experience
- Understanding of community-led solutions and participatory approaches to environmental change
- Commitment to community empowerment over corporate greenwashing or NGO careerism
- Experience with cooperative economics and alternative ownership models

**Our Solution:**
Empathy Ledger enables environmental justice professionals to demonstrate their expertise through storytelling rather than resume optimization. Stories reveal how someone actually approaches environmental work, what values guide their organizing, and how their experience has developed through authentic community engagement.

**Platform Aligned with Climate Justice Values:**
- **Community Ownership:** Platform governance includes frontline community participation rather than corporate control
- **Economic Justice:** 70% of revenue flows to content creators (storytellers) rather than being extracted by platform owners
- **Frontline Leadership:** Designed to amplify grassroots organizing expertise rather than credentialed environmentalism
- **Alternative Economics:** Cooperative platform model demonstrates Just Transition principles in practice

**Immediate Opportunity:**
We're launching a $1000 Storyteller Program with several climate justice organizers and environmental justice leaders to demonstrate how storytelling reveals authentic frontline expertise. CJA member organizations could:

- **Discover frontline environmental professionals** whose expertise comes from community organizing rather than academic environmentalism
- **Support grassroots organizer economic empowerment** through platform participation and revenue sharing
- **Connect with climate justice advocates** committed to community-controlled solutions and alternative economics
- **Advance movement building** through community-owned professional networking that strengthens rather than fragments organizing networks

**Example Value:**
Rather than hiring "Environmental Justice Coordinator with community organizing experience," you could connect with someone whose story demonstrates how they've built power with frontline communities, developed community-led environmental campaigns, and created organizing strategies that address root causes rather than symptoms.

**Next Steps:**
Would someone from CJA be interested in exploring how storytelling-centered networking might serve your member organizations' talent needs while supporting frontline organizer professional development and movement building?

You can learn more about our community-centered approach at acurioustractor.org and our commitment to cooperative economics at [platform cooperative documentation].

**This is about proving that environmental networks should be owned by frontline communities rather than extractive corporations.**

In struggle and solidarity,

Ben Knight
Co-founder, A Curious Tractor
Creator, Empathy Ledger
ben@acurioustractor.org

P.S. Our platform development is guided by community advisors who ensure we build tools that serve movement building rather than reproducing extractive patterns in environmental organizing.

### **Email 3: U.S. Federation of Worker Cooperatives**

**To:** USFWC contact form + cooperative development networks
**Subject:** "Platform Cooperative for Professional Networking: Community Ownership Meets Talent Discovery"

```
Dear USFWC Team,

Greetings from the cooperative movement! My name is Ben Knight, and I'm reaching out from A Curious Tractor about work that embodies cooperative principles in professional networking technology.

We're building Empathy Ledger as a platform cooperative‚Äîthe storytelling-centered alternative to LinkedIn with community ownership, democratic governance, and revenue sharing built into the technical architecture.

**Connection to USFWC's Work:**
Your support for worker cooperative development requires professionals who understand democratic governance, participatory decision-making, and alternative economics. But traditional platforms reduce cooperative expertise to job titles that miss the deep relationship-building and community organizing skills that make cooperatives successful.

**The Cooperative Challenge:**
When you're seeking cooperative developers, organizers, or technical assistance providers, LinkedIn shows credentials but can't reveal who has:
- Experience with democratic governance and conflict resolution in cooperative contexts
- Understanding of cooperative economics and alternative ownership models
- Commitment to worker empowerment and community accountability
- Skills in cooperative education, member engagement, and participatory decision-making

**Platform Cooperative Solution:**
Empathy Ledger operates as a platform cooperative where:
- **Democratic Governance:** Users participate in platform policy decisions rather than being subject to corporate control
- **Revenue Sharing:** 70% of platform income flows to content creators (storytellers) with plans for member ownership expansion
- **Cooperative Values:** Platform design embodies cooperation, community, and mutual aid rather than competition and extraction
- **Member Control:** Storytellers own their content and participate in platform governance

**Immediate Opportunity:**
We're launching a $1000 Storyteller Program with several cooperative leaders and alternative economy organizers to demonstrate how storytelling reveals authentic cooperative expertise. USFWC could:

- **Discover cooperative professionals** whose expertise comes from hands-on cooperative organizing and democratic governance experience
- **Support cooperative movement economic empowerment** through member-owned platform participation
- **Connect with cooperative developers** committed to movement building and alternative economic systems
- **Advance platform cooperativism** by participating in cooperative professional networking demonstration

**Example Value:**
Rather than hiring "Cooperative Developer with relevant experience," you could connect with someone whose story demonstrates how they've facilitated democratic decision-making through organizational conflict, built worker ownership structures that actually empower members, and developed cooperative education that builds movement rather than just individual cooperatives.

**Cooperative Platform Features:**
- **Member Ownership:** Transition plan toward user ownership of platform equity
- **Democratic Decision-Making:** Voting systems for platform policies and feature development
- **Revenue Distribution:** Transparent sharing of platform profits with member-creators
- **Cooperative Education:** Platform serves as demonstration of cooperative principles in technology

**Next Steps:**
Would someone from USFWC be interested in exploring how platform cooperativism might serve cooperative movement talent needs while advancing worker ownership in technology?

You can learn more about our cooperative approach at acurioustractor.org and our platform cooperative model at [governance documentation].

**This is about proving that professional networking platforms can be owned and controlled by their users rather than extractive corporations.**

In cooperation and solidarity,

Ben Knight
Co-founder, A Curious Tractor
Creator, Empathy Ledger (Platform Cooperative)
ben@acurioustractor.org

P.S. We're developing toward full platform cooperative structure with member ownership, democratic governance, and cooperative education integrated into platform functionality.
