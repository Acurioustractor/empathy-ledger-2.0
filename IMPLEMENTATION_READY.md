## 🚀 Next Steps (Priority Order)

### **Immediate (This Week)**
1. **Review Documentation**: Team reads all docs together
2. **Set Up GitHub**: Create repository and configure secrets
3. **Configure Environments**: Set up Supabase staging/production
4. **Test Workflow**: Create test feature branch and deploy to staging

### **Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1)**
1. **Initialize Git Workflow**
   ```bash
   # Set up repository
   git remote add origin https://github.com/your-org/empathy-ledger.git
   git push -u origin main
   
   # Create develop branch
   git checkout -b develop
   git push -u origin develop
   ```

2. **Configure GitHub Secrets**
   - `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY_STAGING`
   - `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY_PRODUCTION`
   - `VERCEL_TOKEN`
   - `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` & `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
   - `SLACK_WEBHOOK` for notifications

3. **Set Up Environments**
   ```bash
   # Development
   npm run setup
   
   # Staging
   npm run deploy:staging
   
   # Production (when ready)
   npm run deploy:production
   ```

### **Phase 2: Migration Preparation (Week 2)**
1. **Backup Current Airtable Data**
   ```bash
   npm run airtable:export
   ```

2. **Test Migration in Staging**
   ```bash
   npm run migrate:dry-run
   npm run migrate:staging
   ```

3. **Validate All Systems**
   ```bash
   npm run test:integration
   npm run security:scan
   npm run compliance:check
   ```

### **Phase 3: Production Migration (Week 3)**
1. **Execute Migration Plan** (following IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md)
2. **Monitor System Health**
3. **Train Team on New Workflows**

## ⚠️ Critical Safety Notes

### **Before Any Migration**
1. ✅ **Complete backup** of all Airtable data
2. ✅ **Test in staging** with production-like data
3. ✅ **Team notification** of maintenance window
4. ✅ **Rollback plan** tested and ready

### **Database Changes**
1. ✅ **Always use migration branches** (`migration/feature-name`)
2. ✅ **Include rollback scripts** for every migration
3. ✅ **Test rollback process** before production
4. ✅ **Database admin approval** required

### **Production Deployments**
1. ✅ **Automatic backup** created before deployment
2. ✅ **Health checks** pass before marking complete
3. ✅ **Monitoring** active for post-deployment issues
4. ✅ **Team notification** of deployment status
