    "title": "The Future of Oonchiumpa",
    "content": "\\# The Future of Oonchiumpa\n\n[00:00:00] Unfortunately, a lot of our young people, are currently living in overcrowding housing.\n\nLiving with the influx of different family members, traveling from community to stay with them. It really is a struggle, because a lot of the family members are quite often, eating the food in their house and sleeping on their beds and are taking over their household.\n\nIt's important for us to have a safe home. And for our young people to feel like a kid and to be a kid within a safe environment and have an opportunity to have their own bed, to have their own belongings to be a kid and to, have the same experience that many other Australians have that take advantage of having their own room and beds.\n\nWe wanna be able to create that safe space for many of our young people that we're working with because unfortunately at the moment there's a lack of housing, which leads to a lack of sleep for our young people, which leads to a low attendance of school [00:01:00] education. Then also quite often, our young people are breaking in and looking for food and being out on the streets because there is such an overcrowding house that they don't wanna be home.\n\nI think we're unique as Oonchiumpa because we are Traditional Owners.\n\nWe are respected and we do have the expertise, whether that's in education in, employment governance and Centrelink . And also law, we wanna be able to have a space where people are invited to come to us, to seek, what avenue, what pathway do we, support this young person.\n\nAt the moment they're currently coming to us to seek that information. And how do we as Oonchiumpa make sure that we're not, being used? And how do we create our own revenue of businesses that are coming to us and government and organisations. I think Oonchiumpa to have a space where we invite people to be [00:02:00] a part of our network, but then also create revenue for them to consult with us, to, alright, I need a program for this young person and I need his identity, I need his connections. I need his role models., And then you go and look, okay, , what does his training and development look like? What does his education look like? But how is he this young person able to advocate for himself as well? \n\nMany of these kids, they come from big families. They come from big kinship, relationships and kinship family groups as well. So we wanna be able to tap into kinship families that we know that they're related to, but also start empowering the families to create a big family space and bringing everyone along for the journey so that everyone has a role to play because in a part of the kinship system, everyone does have a role to play. And even supporting, older siblings who are [00:03:00] looking after younger siblings who unfortunately don't have parents. So we wanna be able to showcase this is how we can support, and as our big family, you're a part of our family and this is, how we can try and support you in all of these, family aspects as well.\n\nI think Oonchiumpa wants to be in a position to have an Oonchiumpa hub. So our, young people, a lot of our, middle aged, a lot of our teenagers, young adults, rather than them going to all of our services. One hub for all nationalities because we know what Tang Jira can provide. We know what Congress can provide. We know what Naja can provide. We know what, training and developments there are, there's no one hub service. So we wanna be able to cultural authority groups holding one hub for all service providers and all programs. At the moment, Oonchiumpa provide a brokerage [00:04:00] for all our Aboriginal businesses and so we're able to tap in and use all our Aboriginal businesses. We wanted to be able to have an Oonchiumpa hub to be able to service all of our young people service all of our community members. If community members are coming in from, Mutujulu, Doca, river Literature country, we'll have somebody that can handle that community. So I need to access a PY Lands, I need to access NPY. So that's all in that region.\n\nWe can connect you to the CEO there. We can connect you to workers there. If you've got, young people coming in from Yin moon. What does that look like in terms of connecting them with their, tanami training development out there, Tanami, because Tanami is out on their Country, how can we connect them with those dots?\n\nBeing in a position to navigate and connect people in the right services and the right programs. And we would definitely, that was our whole [00:05:00] vision. We wanted to have an Oonchiumpa hub. , And because also, for the young people, we don't have an in-house playground.\n\nThat's what Kylie and Tanya is. We've got over all the mappings out already. Where's our playground, indoor playground. It's so hot here. But we wanna be able to create that. Like, where is that? So we wanna just have that space and for our young people to work and to be proud of something that's theirs.\n\nAs a traditional owner in Banis, coming from two big pioneer families, the Bloomfield side, on my father's side and the Liddle side, we have many projects, many programs and and two businesses at the moment.\n\nSo first I'll start off with on. On Chomper, we've been able to secure funding with NIAA and that's helping our young people and providing them with an alternative service. And so we are [00:06:00] we're lucky. We've been extended for two years, but that's only to provide. The basic stuff that we're providing now with HBC Henry Bloomfield contracting dad's out on the graders in community and looking for, an opportunity to expand.\n\nBecause a lot of the aboriginal men on communities, they wanna work with dad, they wanna work with an aboriginal man. Unfortunately, he doesn't have another grader. He doesn't have a camp. He doesn't have a roller, but dad wants to be in a position to also train our young men to be able to have excavated license, a a bulldozer and Bobcat.\n\nAll of those little machinery operation, certificates he wants to be able to provide. We also have Loves Creek, which is on dad's country. So Loves Creek has been handed back to us as traditional owners, and so we have at Napa Homestead and Campground. It's such a unique space out there that we wanna be able to provide a tourism space out there [00:07:00] for us, an opportunity to show our young people.\n\nWhat our old people did in back in the days, a station hand work. We wanna be able to have a homestead there that they feel proud of, that they can go to the homestead. Back then they weren't, a aboriginal people weren't allowed in the homestead. So we wanna create that space as a homestead, as a museum, as a place for them, young fellas to learn.\n\nFrom their old people, old stockmen to be able to have that background with them. And we also have, the Flinders University research that we're working on now, and that'll give us a bit, an idea of all the work that we're doing with the young people. But I feel as though we're missing out on, the younger.\n\nAdults missing out on leading them and empowering them to be able to, gain employment. Why can't they be trainees? Why can't they be tradesmen and stuff? So we wanna be able to create this space and, tradesmen, [00:08:00] stockmen electricians and all of that to be able to, have their own programs on their own community.\n\nAnd I think to do that, we definitely need funding to be able to secure, machinery infrastructure resources and support in terms of, renovating what we currently have to thrive in being able to build our, and empower our young people and aboriginal people in central Australia.\n\nAs the chair of current chair of, I think. We wanna be able to bring back authority. Cultural authority for us is our under people on our land. And so in order to support Tupa, we wanna be able to, empower our traditional owners, and our state groups, and. And, start making people accountable, but also empowering them to be able to stand up and talk freely and to be in a position to [00:09:00] challenge government and to be in a position to, take the lead on many of our opportunities and many of our programs and services as well.\n\nWe need funding to be able to sustain what we have, but also to grow it. Because at the moment we, we don't have any funding to grow what we already have. We're. Covering our bills at the moment and we wanna be able to support many of our Aboriginal people because a lot do come to us, a family and a lot of also community members are looking for employment from us.\n\nSo we wanna be in a position to be funded, to be able to create these pathways for many of our community members.\n\n",

So we wanna be able to showcase this is how we can support, and as our big family, you're a part of our family and this is, how we can try and support you in all of these, family aspects as well.\n\nI think Oonchiumpa wants to be in a position to have an Oonchiumpa hub. So our, young people, a lot of our, middle aged, a lot of our teenagers, young adults, rather than them going to all of our services. One hub for all nationalities because we know what Tang Jira can provide. We know what Congress can provide. We know what Naja can provide. We know what, training and developments there are, there's no one hub service. So we wanna be able to cultural authority groups holding one hub for all service providers and all programs. At the moment, Oonchiumpa provide a brokerage [00:04:00] for all our Aboriginal businesses and so we're able to tap in and use all our Aboriginal businesses. We wanted to be able to have an Oonchiumpa hub to be able to service all of our young people service all of our community members. If community members are coming in from, Mutujulu, Doca, river Literature country, we'll have somebody that can handle that community. So I need to access a PY Lands, I need to access NPY. So that's all in that region.\n\nWe can connect you to the CEO there. We can connect you to workers there. If you've got, young people coming in from Yin moon. What does that look like in terms of connecting them with their, tanami training development out there, Tanami, because Tanami is out on their Country, how can we connect them with those dots?\n\nBeing in a position to navigate and connect people in the right services and the right programs. And we would definitely, that was our whole [00:05:00] vision. We wanted to have an Oonchiumpa hub. , And because also, for the young people, we don't have an in-house playground.\n\nThat's what Kylie and Tanya is. We've got over all the mappings out already. Where's our playground, indoor playground. It's so hot here. But we wanna be able to create that. Like, where is that? So we wanna just have that space and for our young people to work and to be proud of something that's theirs.\n\nAs a traditional owner in Banis, coming from two big pioneer families, the Bloomfield side, on my father's side and the Liddle side, we have many projects, many programs and and two businesses at the moment.\n\nSo first I'll start off with on. On Chomper, we've been able to secure funding with NIAA and that's helping our young people and providing them with an alternative service. And so we are [00:06:00] we're lucky. We've been extended for two years, but that's only to provide. The basic stuff that we're providing now with HBC Henry Bloomfield contracting dad's out on the graders in community and looking for, an opportunity to expand.\n\nBecause a lot of the aboriginal men on communities, they wanna work with dad, they wanna work with an aboriginal man. Unfortunately, he doesn't have another grader. He doesn't have a camp. He doesn't have a roller, but dad wants to be in a position to also train our young men to be able to have excavated license, a a bulldozer and Bobcat.\n\nAll of those little machinery operation, certificates he wants to be able to provide. We also have Loves Creek, which is on dad's country. So Loves Creek has been handed back to us as traditional owners, and so we have at Napa Homestead and Campground. It's such a unique space out there that we wanna be able to provide a tourism space out there [00:07:00] for us, an opportunity to show our young people.\n\nWhat our old people did in back in the days, a station hand work. We wanna be able to have a homestead there that they feel proud of, that they can go to the homestead. Back then they weren't, a aboriginal people weren't allowed in the homestead. So we wanna create that space as a homestead, as a museum, as a place for them, young fellas to learn.\n\nFrom their old people, old stockmen to be able to have that background with them. And we also have, the Flinders University research that we're working on now, and that'll give us a bit, an idea of all the work that we're doing with the young people. But I feel as though we're missing out on, the younger.\n\nAdults missing out on leading them and empowering them to be able to, gain employment. Why can't they be trainees? Why can't they be tradesmen and stuff? So we wanna be able to create this space and, tradesmen, [00:08:00] stockmen electricians and all of that to be able to, have their own programs on their own community.\n\nAnd I think to do that, we definitely need funding to be able to secure, machinery infrastructure resources and support in terms of, renovating what we currently have to thrive in being able to build our, and empower our young people and aboriginal people in central Australia.\n\nAs the chair of current chair of, I think. We wanna be able to bring back authority. Cultural authority for us is our under people on our land. And so in order to support Tupa, we wanna be able to, empower our traditional owners, and our state groups, and. And, start making people accountable, but also empowering them to be able to stand up and talk freely and to be in a position to [00:09:00] challenge government and to be in a position to, take the lead on many of our opportunities and many of our programs and services as well.\n\nWe need funding to be able to sustain what we have, but also to grow it. Because at the moment we, we don't have any funding to grow what we already have. We're. Covering our bills at the moment and we wanna be able to support many of our Aboriginal people because a lot do come to us, a family and a lot of also community members are looking for employment from us.\n\nSo we wanna be in a position to be funded, to be able to create these pathways for many of our community members.\n\n",

    "content": "# Deep Time: Learning to Walk Together - A NAIDOC Week Reflection with Jimmy Frank Jupurrurla\n_For NAIDOC Week 2025_\nThere's a different quality to time when you sit with Jimmy Frank Jupurrurla. It stretches and breathes, unfolds in layers that connect the boomerangs he crafted with old fellas at nineteen to the housing revolution he's leading today. In his presence, you understand that wisdom isn't measured in minutes but in generations, that true learning requires a patience most of us have forgotten how to hold.\n\"My name Jimmy Frank Jupurrurla,\" he begins, \"I'm Warumungu, I grew up in Tennant and I got ties from my father in Tennant Creek. One of the Traditional Owners, I have connection to Tennant Creek through from my father's mother, so it was my grandmother's and my grandfather a little bit north, north of Tennant Creek and I got connection also from from my mother's side, around Hermannsburg.\"\nThis is how real introductions work - not just a name, but a constellation of relationships, a mapping of belonging that reaches both backwards and forwards through time.\nWhen Jimmy speaks about Wilya Janta, the housing project where he serves as chairperson, his words carry the weight of centuries of others making decisions for his people.\n\"Once you look at when they came out of missions or out of... when white man first came to here, they moved us around like cattle, you know, and then sheep. And when we were moving in these places, they were non-Indigenous people. These white people were making decisions for us mob. And then over 75, 70 years or 80 years, someone's been doing something for us mob. Then building something and making decisions for us mob, even when the first contact with whitefella, someone else been making decisions for us mob. So we got to break that cycle.\"\n\nAnd Wilya Janta is breaking that cycle. Not with grand pronouncements or government initiatives, but with the radical act of asking Aboriginal people what kind of houses they want to live in. Houses that understand ceremony, that accommodate family structures that don't fit nuclear Western models, that work with the climate rather than against it.\n\"These houses are not right,\" Jimmy says of the current housing stock. It's not a complaint - it's a diagnosis. And more importantly, it's followed by solution: \"Indigenous people want to have mob in to design their own house.\"\nThere's a moment in our conversation where Jimmy's voice shifts, carries an edge of something between bewilderment and knowing exactly where the money goes.\n\"As a Traditional Owner for this country, there's programs and there's a lot of money going into our town, but we've got very little to show for it. So what I'm saying is, as a traditional owner, I think a lot of people benefiting from Aboriginal people in this town and these are non-Indigenous people. These are organisations that come from down New South Wales, Victoria, somewhere like that.\"\n\"As Indigenous people, our strong points are not pencil and paper,\" Jimmy explains. \"Our strengths is our culture, our country, you know, and our language. Why aren't this implemented in any of these billions of dollars programs?\"\n\"Say the Youth Justice program. I don't see these, I don't know where the money's going. There's like $3 billion that came in the last three years in Tennant. I don't know where that going. But also every year we got ceremony that happens here and surrounding Tennant Creek. We got native title and extinguished native title in Tennant Creek, and the native title, and we got freehold. So we got all this land. Why isn't every Aboriginal kid got thier Country and home to go back to? Why isn't our culture or our Elders are being involved in programs?\"\n\nThis is the question that should keep every policymaker awake at night. How do you spend billions addressing problems while systematically excluding the solutions that already exist in community, in culture, in the knowledge systems that have sustained life on this continent for over 65,000 years?\nSometimes the entire dysfunction of a system reveals itself in a single moment. For brother of Jimmy, Norman Frank, that moment came when he had solar panels installed on his roof through Original Power and Wilya Janta's advocacy - the first community housing tenant in the NT to have solar. But there was a catch: he couldn't turn them on.\n\"He wanted to hit the switch, but he couldn't,\" Jimmy tells me. \"He had to go through hoops and procedures... They didn't let him have the power.\"\nHere was a man with the solution to his power poverty literally sitting on his roof, generating electricity from the abundant Central Australian sun, and he had to wait for a Minister to fly up from Darwin to ceremonially flip a switch he could have flipped himself. If you want to understand the infantilisation of Indigenous people in this country, start there - with a grown man not being trusted to turn on his own power.\nThroughout our conversation, I'm struck by how Jimmy teaches without teaching, how he creates space for understanding to emerge rather than forcing it. When I ask clumsy questions about why Indigenous-led solutions haven't happened before, he doesn't lecture. Instead, he paints a picture: \"When white man first came here, they moved us around like cattle.\"\nThis is pedagogy rooted in respect for the listener's ability to understand, to connect dots, to feel the weight of history without having it explained in patronising detail. It's a generosity of spirit that assumes the best of the learner while never compromising the truth of what needs to be told.\nWhen he speaks about the young fellas he works with, about ceremony and culture, about the dance groups and the arts collective Burruja, you see how knowledge moves in his world - not through curricula or formal instruction, but through presence, through doing, through the patient accumulation of understanding that comes from showing up, again and again.\n\"I really like your project,\" Jimmy says about the work we're doing with washing machines designed for remote communities. But what he's really endorsing isn't the machines - it's the approach. Simple rather than complicated. Built to last rather than break. Designed with actual use patterns in mind rather than urban assumptions.\n\nBut then he offers something more: a vision of how stories themselves can become sovereign. When we discuss creating systems where people own their own narratives, where cultural knowledge is protected and controlled by those who hold it, his response cuts to the heart of it: \"I'm all for people making a difference and making it easy, and then empowering our people... but I got an issue with someone using our word to benefit themself.\"\nThis is the crux of it - the difference between extraction and exchange, between taking stories and creating platforms for stories to be shared on their own terms.\nWhat Jimmy has taught me, more than anything, is about time.\nNot clock time or project time or funding-cycle time, but the kind of deep time required for real understanding. The time it takes to see patterns across generations, to understand how a conversation about washing machines connects to sovereignty, how a solar panel switch embodies decades of disempowerment.\n\"I grew up in childhood out in the bush with my father,\" he tells me, \"learned a lot of tradition and life, and that sort of helped me on my life journey.\" This learning wasn't a curriculum or a program - it was life itself, knowledge absorbed through presence, through watching, through being guided by those who came before.\nThis is what we - white Australia - have to understand. The work of walking together isn't a project or an initiative. It's a fundamental reorientation to time, to learning, to our place in a story that started long before we arrived. It requires us to shut up and listen, to follow rather than lead, to understand that the solutions we seek already exist in the communities we've systematically ignored.\nJimmy speaks of his work with quiet pride - the cultural liaison role, the arts practice that started with those old fellas when he was nineteen, the way he helps ceremony continue, the youth he guides. But he also speaks of exhaustion, of fighting the same fights over and over, of watching money flow around but never quite to where it's needed.\nYet still he shows up. Still he teaches those of us willing to learn. Still he works to ensure that the next generation of Aboriginal kids have \"country and home to go back to.\"\nThis is what reconciliation actually looks like - not grand gestures or formal apologies, but the daily work of reshaping systems, of creating space for Indigenous leadership, of learning to value different kinds of knowledge. It's understanding that when we make this journey, we're not doing anyone a favour. We're saving ourselves from the poverty of a worldview that sees only one way of being in the world.\nAs NAIDOC Week 2025 unfolds, I carry Jimmy's words with me: \"We need to be empowered ourself here and then held accountable.\" This is a statement of what should be obvious. That people have the right to make decisions about their own lives. That the world's oldest continuing culture might have something to teach the rest of us. That the future we need already exists in the knowledge of those we've pushed to the margins.\nThe invitation is there, carried in every story Jimmy shares, every patient explanation, every moment he takes to help someone like me understand. The question is whether we have the humility to accept it, the patience to learn properly, and the courage to reimagine our systems based on what we discover.\nIn that different quality of time that Jimmy inhabits, where past and future fold into present action, where ceremony and solar panels and washing machines all connect in a web of community care, there's a richness of being that our rushing world has forgotten.\nThis NAIDOC Week, may we all slow down enough to glimpse it.\n_With deep gratitude to Jimmy Frank Jupurrurla for his time, teaching, and trust. May we prove worthy of the knowledge shared._\n_[Author's note: This piece was written with permission, centring Jimmy's voice and perspectives as shared in our recorded conversation. Any errors in understanding remain my own.]_\n",

What do you think in terms of what it actually does to people?\\~~[00:00:00] \n\nThe bigger impact is you don't realise it, it may seem like only a small thing. If you've got a washing machine and a dryer home, you don't even have to worry about these kinds of things or where you're gonna wash your clothes or, today I was up to my I actually, I had no more clean jo on socks left.\n\nIt was basically get me washing done today and without you guys, I would've been lugging it up to the bloody laundry mat. Paying an amount of money, which is literally 20, 30 bucks that someone like me in this position, I don't have that 30 bucks. Like we don't have that. So a service like this, like I said, and until you don't have it, is you don't realise how much of a convenience having a washing machine is.\n\nLike most times you throw 'em in the basket at home and they get washed, don't they like, and they're there, but. No. So for someone to actually think about this and think about that service that needs to be provided, and it's it's godsend mate, it's bloody awesome. It's bloody awesome. \\~~And even all chatting with all the blokes.\\~~\n\n\\~~Great service. Great service. We can't say thank you enough.\\~~\n\n",

And \\~~[00:00:00] For many people, they're just two disasters away from needing this service or needing a roof over their head. And, yeah. So that's the sad part of it, but providing some service, providing some help, it's always appreciated.\n\nI thought in the beginning, and I can't remember it happening, but I remember just getting like a birthday. It can, like happy birthday from the whole Orange Sky, which was really nice.\n\nSo I don't know if it happened, whether it's as, it's got bigger, it's been quite so much, but I really thought that's just looking after your volunteers and I like that. 'cause again, in schools we rely on volunteers. So I know the importance of, you still gotta appreciate what time people are putting in.\n\n\\~~So Yeah, and I think the organizations. Really good at trying to do that. 'cause you've got a whole range of different people and personalities.\\~~\n\n",

So it is about knowing your story [00:01:00] first . The second thing, then, is that when we engage in that space, with the two worlds and the other world with the other understanding, there are people who are wanting to come into this space, and would love to be able to engage with me or my people. And I say to folks tell me your story, and I'll tell you my story, and then we'll try and figure out how my story and your story can become our story. The principle doesn't change, it's the practice, and so that's the interesting space.\n\nIt's an easier vehicle to be able to engage with conversation as human beings rather than as first people, second people, or whatever construct you want to use.

We're in Pioneer. I grew up the, there used to be a shop behind me. I grew up playing Tenpin bowling and the house a about 50 meters away. I grew up there before moving to another suburb.\n\nI believe I'm a role model. I'm a leader. I'm quite unique in the sense of I've walked these streets.\n\nI was involved with youth crime. I did a lot of negative things and negative choices all the way up to my adults and I'm not proud of, but. I think the reason I don't say I stand out.\n\nA reason I can connect with young people is because I relate to these young people. Now I'm in a position where I believe I'm giving back. I do my best to as my personal and professionally, I do my best personal and professionally. To do, she put me off. That's good. [00:01:00] My small little, one of the girls that come to the gym.\n\nI don't stand out. I just, I'm well known, I think because of my story, my journey. Good day. No, you make me shame. No. These streets I walk these streets as a young age. I grew up with, I grew up with grassroots people. I grew up with my brothers, my sisters, I didn't, I grew up living my culture through what I do.\n\nI'm proud of my culture. I don't look Aboriginal, but I've always told people who I am, who my mob are. I know my identity. Back to what I was saying getting involved with, I know what it's like to walk these streets and not have nothing, but I've had really good mom and dad to support me.\n\nI've had a good foundation. My partner. I've got good support networks, work colleagues that have got me to where I am. And, to build the story is, I'm from the streets. I think about, I'm from the streets, I've grown up in the streets and I'm giving back to the streets. And this is something I practice what I preach, these young kids it's hard to [00:02:00] see and remember all their names, but I know a lot of them and a love their family.\n\nI really wanna build this new gym in Mount Isa to work with young people, First Nations, Aboriginal Torres Strait, non-Indigenous. I wanna build like a gym and a wellbeing center for people to know that, hey, you can come to this space for your health wellbeing and really anything.\n\nI'm just slowly there, but with any support I can get donation, whatever it is. I'll get there one day and I'm very grateful to be on this journey.\n\nI know there's organisations in community and that are well known and, off. I shouldn't say well off, but they got the funding and they can deliver these things. When people come into my gym, it's a small gym, it's self-funded. I paid for all of the equipment, from working hard from my, through my full-time job.\n\nI have a great team, there's a few of us, but I don't have a, I don't have a hr, I don't have a board. I don't even know what any of that is. I don't even know if I'm a company. Like I'm just me doing me. I'm learning as I go. And but what I can offer is I can [00:03:00] offer, programs throughout Mount Isa and Lower Gulf, around, youth crime and recidivism.\n\nI can offer on Country programs i'm in a position now where I'm willing to learn all those things. I don't have it now, but I'll eventually get it\n\n. I hope to go away bra.\n\nI grown up growing up in Mount Isa, I wasn't the best in school. I didn't apply myself. I was known to be a naughty kid. I was known to not do much in life and because of the choices I made, but. Now I'm in a position where I believe I've done really well for myself, for my community, and I'm giving back.\n\nAnd I hope that through my journey and through my experiences and through the work that I do every day, I can inspire these young kids to, do the same, apply themselves on school, get into programs, get the support, reach out, talk about their mental health. And hopefully one day, I'm standing behind the camera interviewing these young kids.\n\nAbout their journey and where they've come from and now they're given back and that's all it's about is, to move [00:04:00] forward we gotta give back. And I do that every day. So hopefully I'm on the right track. I believe I am. Just need a bit more education, a bit of help.\n\n\n\n",

    "content": "\\# Mount Isa NAIDOC March Interviews\n\n[00:00:00] So we're down here at Outback at Isa in Mount Isa, celebrating NAIDOC. Every year we come down here community puts on a feed around seven o'clock to nine o'clock.\n\nAnd then at 9:00 AM we all march as a community. So we're gonna go around and interview some people and enjoy.\n\n​\n\nWhat does NAIDOC mean to you my brother? It means our mob coming together, celebrating our culture and educating everyone else about it. You know, our strong people. Deadly my brother , growing up, in the community, what keeps you strong mentally and physically?\n\nMentally I would just say work, I work in the community, so just helping out people, as well, just helping the mob, you know? \\~~Yeah. And what's your best doggy dance?\\~~\n\nWhat does NAIDOC mean for you? A celebration of my culture, my people, and where people non-Aboriginal [00:01:00] can come in and celebrate and enjoy and respect our culture. Deadly. Yeah. And how long have you done this march for in Mount Isa knee high to a grasshopper.\n\nI've never missed a march no matter where I am on whatever side of the country, I'll find where the NAIDOC March is and attend. Ah, Deadly. What have we got on today down at Outback at Isa? This is where our March will start from. And yeah, and end at \\~~the \\~~the Civic Center.\n\nI think it'll be a day of enjoying and embracing our culture, thank you. Working in community yourself, how can we help more young people in our community? I think we have to, lead by example and show them and teach them how to respect and honour our Elders. Because then that gets passed down and, and I hope , I've done that with my two, that I've grown up, of course, that they respect and their culture as well as their Elders.\n\nDeadly.\n\nWe're here with Uncle Warren King. [00:02:00] He's a Kalkadoon and Elder family friend of mine, someone I've always looked up to in community. What does NAIDOC mean to you? NAIDOC is a legacy that our ancestors and our Elders before us have built for us to carry forward.\n\n\\~~And obviously it's a continuum of what our identity. And our culture is going forward. \\~~I still remember as a young 17-year-old attending my first protest March in Mount Isa when my mother is a founding member of the Aboriginal and Childcare Agency, the Aboriginal Torres Strait Legal Service and Aliana Housing, a staunch, strong, resilient woman.\n\nWho raised eight children by herself and continued to impasse her knowledge onto us to carry her legacy forward. And for me, NAIDOC is about passing that on to our younger generations. And this fellow here, I'm very proud of it because he is doing that as a young man. With his own business and his involvement in community has been staunch strong and resilient as [00:03:00] well.\n\nSo he comes from good stock, so to speak, and he'll continue. And that's what the legacy is all about. Our young leaders coming through to take up the fight for us and keeping the fires burning for us. Thank you uncle. That means a lot. When it comes to working with young people what are some things we can do better or as a community to support more young people?\n\nOne of the things that we have to realize is that not one size fits all with our young people. And we also have to understand that a lot of our children have experienced, intergenerational trauma. So not every one child is the same as everyone.\n\nAnd they need to be treated like that an assessment around just what their capabilities are and then looking at how to provide more to lead them into the future to be our future leaders. And you're doing that with the gym? I love that. I love the Facebook page. I love the way he said the young fellas that go [00:04:00] there how they man up is deadly, you know?\n\nYeah. So that's what it's all about. Bang. \\~~And final thing, show us your best doggy dance. Nah, gammin.\\~~\n\nAlright, so we got Ben here Ben's from Canada. He just started at the same local Aboriginal medical service. I work at Gidgie Healing as a social worker, just met brother boy this week and it's his first week in Mount Isa. So Ben how are you enjoying Mount Isa and how are you enjoying the week?\n\nOh, it's been really good. It is been great to see the community come together for NAIDOC week. Like it's been really cool, all the different events throughout the city. Yep. And it's been a great way to meet people and yeah, it's been awesome. You can see the community spirit here is alive and well.\n\nComing from Canada, myself growing up Mount Isa, like we always give back to youth or our community.\n\nWhat advice you could give me about supporting young people in Mount Isa and some of the work that you've done? I love working with youth. I used to work with youth for like seven years. Oh deadly. And I think just being a safe place.\n\nLike, we're not their dads, we're not their uncles, but like sometimes they just need that safe place just to be themselves. Yeah, of course. And like express [00:05:00] themselves without being judged. Without being ragged on and just able to just be a kid.\n\nLast question. NAIDOC week celebrations as always. Food. How much food have you ate this week? Oh bro, heaps. So much food. Oh man. I packed a lunch yesterday. I didn't even eat it. Oh yeah. It's been awesome.\n\nWe got the deadliest crew. Ah, I shame myself. YPA, youth what, what do I say? I'm shame now. I'm shame myself. \\~~Um, YPA intensive on country program. \\~~So we have YPA, the Intensive on Country program that facilitates in Mount Isa.\n\nThe question I wanna ask the team is, what does NAIDOC mean to you? NAIDOC means to me is about standing proud, for our mob, but also for our community. Celebrating our community and what we achieved over the time.\n\nStanding with our people and marching and getting together as a community . \\~~nAIDOC means when everyone comes together for, I know, the week and celebrate indigenous culture and \\~~can you tell us about more about what you do? Like your work that you are doing with you on Country.\n\nWe take our kids out on country, and teach 'em what it means to feel connected to your culture and your community. And, your best doggy [00:06:00] dance.\n\nHow? How are ya? Good, how are you? Oh, we got the crew. We got the crew. Hello. How are you now? How are you? \\~~What now? Hi. Where dj? Oh, you cutting there? Yeah. Oh, he's busy riding all the way up there. He be on the back wheel. This frick. He mad. Go real far. See? Must already. \\~~Hello, George. Hello darling How are you?\n\nWe got, uncle George here. Uncle George. We just wanna ask you, what does NAIDOC mean to you? Oh, means a lot, especially in this town, the years that I've been involved in it with the police, when I lead it, it's got bigger and bigger every year.\n\nIt is even bigger this year. Yeah. But, it means a lot, to this community and, it's a way to get for all these, agencies to get together and march together as one and have a talk. When we come down these marches, you gotta all talk to each other and find out what we're doing so that, we can help each other.\n\nThere's no use with a lot of these, agencies that they're all doing things that other people are trying to do, but they're all over the place. They've gotta get together and work as one. Uncle George being a Kalkadoon Elder growing up in Mount Isa, what are [00:07:00] some of the highlights, what are you proud of and some highlights growing up in Mount Isa?\n\nWell, I could go back to the years we've come here. My dad come in here 1946, we wasn't the first lot here. The highlight is that there was dirt road here, a lot of dirt road around there when I was here. I'm not too happy about a lot of things.\n\nWe got people coming in here with their issues, which should be stopped. And this town, Mount Isa, a long time ago was one, everyone got on, you could leave your door open, you could enjoy yourself. You go out and have fun and go to a party with all the other families around here.\n\nBut now there's a lot of anger and there shouldn't be. And Uncle George, the reason I ask that question is. Youth crime at the moment in Mount Isa is quite high. The rates of youth crime. And what are some strategies and what are the, some of the things you've done in the community, like me growing up in Mount Isa, looking up to you, what are some of the things you could give me some [00:08:00] advice and also share some of the work you do.\n\nOh, it starts with the little kids, you know. You'll see a lot of little kids that walk around the streets and that engage with 'em, talk to 'em, find out what's going on with 'em. \\~~They'll just go past them a, a, you know, and ignore what they're doing. \\~~Pull 'em up and have a chat. What I've done, I went around and I just introduced myself to by showing myself out there with the kids.\n\nThose kids have all locked up to me ever was just Uncle George. What are you doing now at the moment for work? Do you wanna share, tell the mob what you're doing at the moment in the schools and some of the plans you got for the future? Yeah. Well, I proved to the police.\n\nI've worked, I'm working with such at school. I'm a. Community facilitator , which is, getting kids in that school, back to school and, and keeping them to school. . And, and my big thing is there's a lot of these little kids that , they come to school with dirty clothes and stinking because they got no hot water at home.\n\nAnd, we give 'em a shower, and feed them. Yeah. And, and it improves their day. That's right. And a lot of, I, we've got some kids back [00:09:00] there that haven't been to school for years and now they're they're enjoying it. Yeah. They, because the thing is I get 'em together. Yeah. And the last thing, uncle George, um, can you show us your best doggy dance?\n\nThank you Uncle George.\n\nSo my little brother, introduce yourself and what you do in community. My name's Rashad Gavin Isaacson. I'm a local here. Just come down to dance for Mount Isa. For the NAIDOC. Just for our culture. What's the name of the, the dance crew brother that you do? The sundowners? Yep. Kalkadoon sundowners. Deadly my brother. Watching you grow up from a young age. Now you're tall than me, brother. Like what does NAIDOC mean to you? My little brother? Oh, it's just. Culture and it's everything. 'cause it's part of my culture.\n\n\\~~Yeah. That's it. \\~~What are some things we can do? Reckon we should do more for young people in community? Get more people into this stuff tell 'em to come dance.\n\nBring up like let them show them their culture. Like, let 'em open up. That's it, bro. Yeah. And the last thing, your best doggy dance. Hey, [00:10:00] you idiot. You.\n\nTell me who you are and what are we doing here? Hi, I am Danielle Germaine. I'm Brodie's mom, and we're here to celebrate NAIDOC together as family, and yeah, sharing, reconnecting with family, friends, and just enjoying today. Mom, something you taught us since we were babies is to be proud of who we are, our culture, no matter what does NAIDOC mean to you?\n\nBringing together community and reconnecting with family and friends.\n\nUnfortunately I was part of youth crime growing up and I'm, now, I'm in a position giving back. I learned that from you and dad. What are some strategies or advice you could give about how we can prevent youth crime and help these young ones? I think we just got to keep going, be resilient and not to give up. Even though at times where we think we can't do enough for these kids, we just gotta keep trying so they know that they've got someone there to listen out and look for out for.\n\nThank you mama. Love [00:11:00] ya.\n\nAlright, tell us your name and what you do in community . My name's Siva and I'm a youth worker for Injalinji. With your youth work, what is the, some of the work you do? So I do mostly case management, getting kids thier, centerlink, helping them get, work, getting them into boarding school, stuff like that.\n\n\\~~Um, naidoc, quick, good feeds and that. \\~~Have you enjoyed the week ? Enjoying all the new food hey, experiencing new foods I've never tasted before. \\~~Yeah. And um, like NAIDOC wig is about bringing culture to aboriginal culture, but everyone together. Um, \\~~what do you think about naidoc? I think it's good most of these young kids dunno who they are and this is a good event for them to indulge in their culture and all that. And the last thing, \\~~um, \\~~show best doggy dance. \n\n",

Like they're people too. ~[00:00:00] They use drugs. Yes. But they need to be seen as people just like everybody else.\n\nSo I really like there to be some sort of harm reduction awareness training for volunteers in Canberra.\n\nHaving service providers to partner with is a really smart way of doing things because it's not just we park the van and that's it. Like we park the van and we have Vinny's come, or we're at. Red Cross Roadhouse or early morning Center where they're serving food or whatever it is.\n\nIt's not just the one thing, it's we've partnered with someone else and that's the business model and it's smart. So I think always expanding and thinking of how you can expand the service that little bit farther is really smart.\n\nIt's just a matter of, trying to get HQ and the service [00:01:00] volunteer here and all of that stuff. All the pieces put in the right places. I've been trying, I've been trying to do it.\n\n~When I started, a volunteer that was on shift with me had said that somebody asked her, oh, that's great that you're volunteering your time, but like, why not just give them money?~\n\n",

More so listening than talking. I know I say I love talking but really listening is a lot more powerful in my experience. Listen to somebody looking eye to eye smiling, reacting, being surprised, being shattered.\n\nIt builds our fabric together as humanity to be connected. Get to live an experience with somebody who lived in rural Australia here for maybe 20 years. Somebody who live worked in a coal mine, someone who worked as a race a bike racer.

And that's what the legacy is all about. Our young leaders coming through to take up the fight for us and keeping the fires burning for us.\n\n\n\nWe got the deadliest crew. Ah, I shame myself. YPA, youth what, what do I say? I'm shame now. I'm shame [00:02:00] myself. \\~~Um, YPA intensive on country program. \\~~So we have YPA, the Intensive on Country program that facilitates in Mount Isa.\n\nThe question I wanna ask the team is, what does NAIDOC mean to you? NAIDOC means to me is about standing proud, for our mob, but also for our community. Celebrating our community and what we achieved over the time.\n\nStanding with our people and marching and getting together as a community . \\~~nAIDOC means when everyone comes together for, I know, the week and celebrate indigenous culture and\\~~\n\nhow? How are ya? Good, how are you? Oh, we got the crew. We got the crew. Hello. How are you now? How are you? \\~~What now? Hi. Where dj? Oh, you cutting there? Yeah. Oh, he's busy riding all the way up there. He be on the back wheel. This frick. He mad. Go real far. See? Must already. \\~~Hello, George. Hello darling How are you?\n\nWe got, uncle George here. Uncle George. We just wanna ask you, what does NAIDOC mean to you? Oh, means a lot, especially in this town, the years that I've been involved in it with the police, when I lead it, it's got bigger and bigger every year.\n\nIt is even bigger this year. Yeah. But, it means a lot, to this community and, it's a way to get for all these, agencies to get together and march together as one and have a talk. When we come down these marches, you gotta all talk to each other and find out what we're [00:03:00] doing so that, we can help each other.\n\nIt starts with the little kids, you know. You'll see a lot of little kids that walk around the streets and that engage with 'em, talk to 'em, find out what's going on with 'em. \\~~They'll just go past them a, a, you know, and ignore what they're doing. \\~~Pull 'em up and have a chat.\n\nMy name's Rashad Gavin Isaacson. I'm a local here. Just come down to dance for Mount Isa. For the NAIDOC for our culture. Watching you grow up from a young age. Now you're tall than me, brother. Like what does NAIDOC mean to you? My little brother? Oh, it's just everything. 'cause it's part of my culture.\n\nHi, I am Danielle Germaine. I'm Brodie's mom, and we're here to celebrate NAIDOC together as family, and yeah, sharing, reconnecting with family, friends, and just enjoying today. Mom, something you taught us since we were babies is to be proud of who we are, our culture, no matter what does NAIDOC mean to you?\n\nBringing together community and reconnecting with family and friends.\n\nI think we just got to keep going, be resilient and not to give up. Even though at times where we think we can't do [00:04:00] enough for these kids, we just gotta keep trying so they know that they've got someone there to listen out and look for out for.\n\nThank you mama. Love ya.\n\nEnjoying all the new food hey, experiencing new foods I've never tasted before. \\~~Yeah. And um, like NAIDOC wig is about bringing culture to aboriginal culture, but everyone together. Um, \\~~I think it's good most of these young kids dunno who they are and this is a good event for them to indulge in their culture and all that. And the last thing, \\~~um, \\~~show best doggy dance. \n\n",

    "content": "\\# Navigating Closed Doors: How COVID-19 Shut Down Essential Services\n\n\\~~I really appreciate it. That's cool. Casper, what are you doing? What's what's the last few years been like? The last four years have been a bit crazy.\\~~[00:00:00] \n\nIt's just been quite difficult accessing services. I've just had to work out different ways of getting things done that I had to, thankfully, because where I used to work.\n\nI knew we used to get a lot of people up and moving, so I know you've just got to keep moving and grooving and yeah, that was really fortunate. I come here on I've only really been coming here the last couple of months because I didn't know about it beforehand.\n\nI found it very helpful. They do a meal, it's like a little camaraderie with a few of the guys that seem to be fairly regular and nice. We've got different ladies that volunteer here, but they also seem to be in a roster. I've seen a few of them a couple of times, and it's just nice to know the washing is washed and dried and I've set for the week.\n\nSuch a simple thing, which for me, I can wash that. I cannot go up and downstairs or hang on my clothes line. So it's been like a massive life save. It's been very helpful. \\~~What's the connection like for you here? Like how.\\~~\n\n\\~~I am like, like I said, I've only been a few months, but everybody seems to be unusually nice.\\~~\n\n",

    "content": "\\# Robyn Watts\n\n[00:00:00] \n\nRobin Watts. You want to know my life story? Okay. Got two girls. I started out life as a teacher, working life as a teacher.\n\nDidn't like that and got a job in local government, so I ended up the last job I had there for 20 years. And then after I retired, I discovered orange sky and my husband got sick. And he subsequently died. And Orange Sky, as I've told Nic, saved me. It made me get out of bed every day, try and push through the grief, and it's just been the best thing I've ever done, apart from having a lovely family.\n\nOh, I love it. I just absolutely love it. I honestly believe. [00:01:00] That we give a lot to friends, but they give just as much back. I go home on top of the world some days. Yeah. And I look forward to the days that I'm on shift. I love it. Really love it.\n\nIt was compounded, my husband had myeloma and the life expectancy of myeloma now is seven years, and he died after about. Three and a half. So he didn't last very long. But grief for my husband dying was a second wave of grief because six weeks before he died, our 42-year-old son-in-law just died suddenly in Sydney, leaving a 4-year-old and a 6-year-old.\n\nAnd my daughter. And totally unexpected, just completely out of left field. And he was the most wonderful human being. He was [00:02:00] American. And then later on, Ron died. And that was, I think I no, I was in denial of how sick he was. Every time we went to the hematologist, I would. Feel, oh, it wasn't that bad.\n\nIt could have been worse, but something happened to his spleen and he just said one night, I feel like I've got a pain in my chest. So I thought it might have been a heart. His heart went into hospital, didn't come out. And ended up in ICU for a week, which was horrible. Horrible. And then went into palliative care and died the next day.\n\nSo it was, but he had also been an orange sky volunteer, so I felt like I was carrying on the family tradition too by continuing to do that. But it truly did help me get out of bed. I had to, I had no choice. People depending on you, and without that, I [00:03:00] probably could have stayed. But everybody I know has said to me how well I've coped.\n\nAnd I think I've coped reasonably well. But I, I miss him. Of course .\n\nI do on my shift on Thursday, we've got, that's the longest shift we've had.\n\nIt's the oldest shift and we, the team, I've got the two boys I volunteer with, we've been together for years, probably five years. Or Russ has probably been there nearly seven years. And yes, they were supportive. I was very touched that the team leaders all went to Ron's funeral. Very unexpected. And they've helped me a lot.\n\nBut the interesting thing was that the friends. Where my shift on Thursday is the friends knew him too. That was nice, there was a consistency there. But I just I just love it. Absolutely love it. Are there particular things about it that you think are [00:04:00] more profound than others or because I think there's some parts of the, so just simple, but some parts thought out. I think it's, yes, the laundry's important obviously for. People's dignity and they have a right to that. But I think making them feel seen and heard, for me personally, that's really important and genuinely, calling them by name and remembering to ask them something.\n\nOne of my favorite quotes is from Maya Angelou says, people will forget what you said, forget what you did. But they will never forget the way you made them feel. And I really believe that. I think that is true for me, but I try to make that true for them too. So I'll, we'll talk about something that's meaningful to them.\n\nI think one of the trickier things is learning to respect and know the [00:05:00] boundaries because some people don't wanna share that much. And we've got a friend who we would, we are very frustrated. We really wanna be able to help him, but he feels that he has enough and he doesn't want to take anymore.\n\nAnd he struggles, but I've since found out he has got an advocate, which is really good. But that's a failing in the system. I think this particular friend is quite deaf and he's waited probably 18 months to get hearing aids, and I don't know how much they've shown him, but we had a volunteer on the shift one day who'd had some experience as an audiologist.\n\nSo she showed him how to put them in and he said, oh, I can hear now, but I don't, he's not doing it himself and we can't offer he's quite private. And he's quite proud, which we respect.\n\nI'm up to my nine years this year, and I wanna get my 10 years, then I'll get my unpaid long service leave.\n\nNo, I just, that is [00:06:00] a very concrete goal. I want to get to my 10 years. I've got no intention of leaving at this stage. Sometimes some of the processes that come from HQ can be a bit frustrating. I have to say though, I'd like this on record that my regional coordinator, Carolyn, is superb.\n\nShe is the best I've ever worked with. She is just amazing. Her level of support to me as service leader is immeasurable. So she's a buffer between me and the powers that be.\n\nWhat do you think or hope might happen in the next 10 years or in 10 years time? Oh, that's a good question. On a grassroots level, I hope they keep doing what they're doing. And I hope. They don't diverge too much [00:07:00] from that so that they're trying to do so many things and nothing gets done really well. I remember at the last summit I went to, they were talking about going to San Francisco, and I remember saying Then you need to get it working effectively here before you go anywhere else.\n\nI would like to see, a little bit more acknowledgement of a lot of the services. Like anybody who knew me 9, 8, 9 years ago knew that. I always said, we get forgotten down here. And it, I get that we are a long way away. I understand that. But there are times when we. We can't do the things they can do on the mainland.\n\nSo we left feeling a little bit out of things. But in terms of. The the volunteers, I think always uppermost in the minds of the staff should be [00:08:00] what the volunteers are doing because without the volunteers you have no orange sky, you have no ladder to climb, you have nothing. And I think I do what I can for, to acknowledge my team.\n\nWe've got a fabulous team of team leaders, wonderful volunteers, absolutely awesome. But sometimes it's nice to. Know that they're appreciated by others. And it's simple things like, it's our birthday in July last year. They put in the newsletter in the Spin Cycles services, birthdays.\n\nThey didn't put ours in last year. They forgot it. And that's, I know I get that we are one of however many services in Australia, but to us we are the service in Tassie. So that sort of thing upsets me a little bit.\n\nAnd I'm proud of Orange Sky. I'm very proud of Orange Sky. I'm proud to volunteer for it. I'm proud of what it [00:09:00] does. And it's, there's nothing better than when I drive to my shift on Wednesday.\n\nAnthony's there waving when I drive the van in, and, it's just such a positive experience all round. But I do think, I do think that they're going to have to be very careful that they don't lose sight of that up there. \n\n",

And it's not just about out doing something, doing a service. It's also like talking to that person, making them feel like human and like they're someone worth talking to.\n\nI have a lot of conversations with my kids about it. I have two kids. One is 10 and one is seven. And they know that I come on shift on Monday nights. I have to get out of the house on time. I wear my. Uniform. And when I get home they wanna know how did it go? Did you meet anyone new? Did you do a lot of laundry? Those kinds of things. And it's really nice to be able to share with them why I do it and why it's important to take care of people, [00:01:00] even if they're people that you don't know.\n\n~It's no secret. I tell everyone that I volunteer and, i've made it known to a lot of people. I've done the Sudsy challenge a few times.~\n\n",

Seen and heard and felt, and certainly I think that \\~~[00:00:00] Healthy homes is the start of everything because you need to have a home that you can call home and that you're happy with, and the wind can flow in and out and you can have your family there and you're free from mites in your in your home and in your walls and in your bed.\n\n\\*\\*Speaker 3:\\*\\* And you can have a kitchen that you can cook in and have a roof over your head and a home that's not too hot in the summer and not too freezing in the winter when it doesn't need to be. And also one that's not costing a bomb. And in fact you don't even know that it's costing and then all of a sudden you have no power.\n\n\\*\\*Speaker 3:\\*\\* So for me, we've seen lots of homes, that felt a bit uncomfortable. Didn't feel that it was the home that you'd wanna call home. There's lots that I've learned, but I've also learned that, the people in the culture here are really great people and they want just look after their family and look after their community [00:01:00] and spending time with Patricia and LT and Dianne, and then meeting at the cultural center, which is really amazing. Mr. Jones and Jimmy and just hearing about the journey that people from Tenant Creek have been on to where they are now that's first. And then I bring that role of being a CEO and that's a blessing that I feel that I've got some influence to make some change.\n\n\\*\\*Speaker 3:\\*\\* And, for us at The Snow Foundation, it is about listening to communities and empowering communities. That's a big part. And it's also about backing really great people. \\~~So we've been lucky to be joined by the team from the goods project who are doing these beds. Really simple beds that are really lightweight crates.\\~~\n\n",
