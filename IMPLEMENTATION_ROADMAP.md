### Team Preparation
- [ ] All team members have read the architecture strategy document
- [ ] Database administrator identified and briefed
- [ ] Support team ready for migration window
- [ ] Communication plan for users established

## Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1)

### Day 1-2: Backup Current State
```bash
# 1. Export all Airtable data
node scripts/airtable-migration/migrate-airtable-to-supabase.js --export-only

# 2. Create Supabase baseline backup
pg_dump $DATABASE_URL > backups/baseline-$(date +%s).sql

# 3. Document current state
# - Record counts per table
# - Key relationships
# - Active users/projects
```

### Day 3-4: Setup Infrastructure
```bash
# 1. Initialize backup system
npm run setup:backup

# 2. Test backup and restore
npm run backup:test

# 3. Configure monitoring
# - Set up alerts
# - Dashboard for migration progress
```

### Day 5: Staging Environment
```bash
# 1. Create staging Supabase project
# 2. Apply bulletproof schema
psql $STAGING_DATABASE_URL < supabase/migrations/20240120_bulletproof_schema.sql

# 3. Verify schema creation
npm run verify:schema
```

## Phase 2: Migration Testing (Week 2)

### Day 1-2: Dry Run Migration
```bash
# 1. Run migration in dry-run mode
DRY_RUN=true node scripts/airtable-migration/migrate-airtable-to-supabase.js

# 2. Review migration report
# - Check for errors
# - Verify transformations
# - Validate data integrity
```

### Day 3-4: Staging Migration
```bash
# 1. Full migration to staging
node scripts/airtable-migration/migrate-airtable-to-supabase.js --target=staging

# 2. Run validation suite
npm run test:migration

# 3. Application testing
# - Point dev environment to staging
# - Test all critical paths
# - Verify permissions/RLS
```

### Day 5: Performance Testing
```bash
# 1. Load testing
npm run test:load

# 2. Query optimization
# - Review slow queries
# - Add necessary indexes
# - Test with production-like data volume
```

## Phase 3: Production Migration (Week 3)

### Pre-Migration (Day Before)
```bash
# 1. Final Airtable export
node scripts/airtable-migration/migrate-airtable-to-supabase.js --export-only --final

# 2. Create migration checkpoint
npm run backup:full

# 3. Notify users of maintenance window
```

### Migration Day
```bash
# 1. Enable maintenance mode (2 AM)
npm run maintenance:enable

# 2. Final data sync
node scripts/sync-final-changes.js

# 3. Execute production migration (2:30 AM)
node scripts/airtable-migration/migrate-airtable-to-supabase.js --target=production

# 4. Verify migration (4 AM)
npm run verify:production

# 5. Switch application to new database (5 AM)
npm run switch:database

# 6. Monitor and verify (5-7 AM)
npm run monitor:health

# 7. Disable maintenance mode (7 AM)
npm run maintenance:disable
```

### Post-Migration
```bash
# 1. Monitor error logs
tail -f logs/application.log

# 2. Check user reports
# 3. Performance monitoring
# 4. Backup verification
```

## Phase 4: Stabilization (Week 4)

### Days 1-3: Monitoring & Fixes
- Monitor application performance
- Address any data issues
- Optimize slow queries
- User support for any issues

### Days 4-5: Documentation
- Update all technical documentation
- Create user guides for new features
- Document lessons learned
- Update runbooks

## Critical Commands Reference

### Backup Operations
```bash
# Manual full backup
npm run backup:full

# Restore from backup
npm run restore --backup-id=backup-1234567890-full

# Verify backups
npm run backup:verify

# List available backups
npm run backup:list
```

### Migration Operations
```bash
# Export Airtable data
npm run airtable:export

# Run migration (dry run)
npm run migrate:dry

# Run migration (staging)
npm run migrate:staging

# Run migration (production)
npm run migrate:production

# Verify migration
npm run migrate:verify
```

### Emergency Procedures
```bash
# Rollback to previous state
npm run rollback --to=checkpoint-id

# Emergency backup
npm run backup:emergency

# Disaster recovery
npm run recover --scenario=data_loss

# Database health check
npm run db:health
```

## Success Criteria

### Technical Metrics
- [ ] Zero data loss during migration
- [ ] All automated tests passing
- [ ] Query performance within acceptable ranges
- [ ] Backup system operational
- [ ] RLS policies enforced correctly

### Business Metrics
- [ ] All users can access their data
- [ ] Stories display correctly
- [ ] Community features functional
- [ ] Value tracking operational
- [ ] No critical bugs reported

## Risk Mitigation

### High-Risk Areas
1. **Data Relationships**
   - Mitigation: Extensive testing in staging
   - Rollback: Restore from checkpoint

2. **User Authentication**
   - Mitigation: Test auth flow thoroughly
   - Rollback: Revert to original auth system

3. **Performance Degradation**
   - Mitigation: Load testing and optimization
   - Rollback: Scale up resources temporarily

### Communication Plan
- **-1 Week**: Email all users about maintenance
- **-1 Day**: Final reminder with exact times
- **During**: Status page updates every hour
- **After**: Success notification and feedback request

## Support Contacts

### Technical Team
- Database Admin: [Contact]
- Backend Lead: [Contact]
- DevOps: [Contact]

### Business Team
- Product Manager: [Contact]
- Community Manager: [Contact]
- Support Lead: [Contact]

### Emergency Escalation
1. Try technical team first
2. Escalate to CTO if needed
3. Emergency vendor support available

## Post-Implementation Review

### Week 5: Review Meeting
- What went well?
- What could be improved?
- Any remaining issues?
- Documentation updates needed?
- Process improvements for future?

### Success Celebration
Once everything is stable and verified:
- Team appreciation
- User communication about new capabilities
- Plan for leveraging new architecture

Remember: **Take backups before every major step. When in doubt, pause and verify. Data integrity is paramount.**

Good luck with the implementation! ðŸš€
