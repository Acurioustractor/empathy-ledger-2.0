# üß† AI ANALYSIS PROCESS FLOW
## How Themes, Quotes, Summaries & Bios Get Created

---

## üåü **PHILOSOPHY-FIRST APPROACH**

Every step prioritizes:
- **Storyteller Dignity**: AI enhances, never replaces human wisdom
- **Explicit Consent**: Each analysis component requires separate consent
- **Strengths-Based**: Focus on resilience, growth, and assets
- **Cultural Humility**: Avoid Western-centric interpretations
- **Trauma-Informed**: Safe, predictable, storyteller-controlled process

---

## üìã **THE 7-STEP PROCESS**

### **1. CONSENT & PREPARATION** 
```
Storyteller ‚Üí Reviews AI Analysis Options ‚Üí Grants Specific Consent
```
- **What happens**: Storyteller chooses which AI features they want
- **Consent granularity**: Themes, quotes, biography, connections (separate)
- **Always optional**: Can say no to any/all AI analysis
- **Timing**: Before any AI processing begins

### **2. STORY PREPARATION**
```
Raw Story ‚Üí Safety Review ‚Üí Content Preparation ‚Üí AI-Ready Format
```
- **Safety check**: Staff review for trauma-informed considerations
- **Content preparation**: Remove identifying details if requested
- **Language detection**: Identify primary language for culturally-appropriate analysis
- **Quality assurance**: Ensure transcript accuracy

### **3. AI ANALYSIS EXECUTION**
```
Story Text ‚Üí OpenAI GPT-4 ‚Üí Research-Backed Prompts ‚Üí Raw Analysis Results
```

**Our AI Prompts Are Research-Backed:**
- **Narrative Therapy** principles (White & Epston, 1990)
- **Trauma-Informed Care** approaches (Herman, 2015) 
- **Strengths-Based Practice** (Saleeby, 2013)
- **Cultural Humility** frameworks (Tervalon & Murray-Garc√≠a, 1998)
- **Community Resilience** theory (Norris et al., 2008)

**Example Theme Extraction Prompt:**
```
Analyze this story through a strengths-based, trauma-informed lens. 
Identify 3-5 themes that demonstrate:
- Resilience and adaptive capacity
- Sources of strength and support
- Growth and learning through challenges
- Connection to community and culture
- Wisdom gained through experience

Avoid deficit language. Focus on assets, not problems.
Respect cultural context. Honor the storyteller's wisdom.
```

### **4. QUALITY ASSURANCE & BIAS DETECTION**
```
Raw AI Results ‚Üí Bias Detection ‚Üí Cultural Sensitivity Check ‚Üí Quality Scoring
```

**Our Quality Metrics:**
- **Cultural Sensitivity Score**: 0-100% (target: 85%+)
- **Trauma-Informed Approach**: 0-100% (target: 90%+)
- **Strengths-Based Language**: 0-100% (target: 90%+)
- **Dignity Preservation**: 0-100% (target: 95%+)
- **Bias Detection**: Flags problematic language/assumptions

**Automatic Flags:**
- Deficit-based language ("suffering from", "victim of")
- Cultural assumptions or stereotypes
- Medical/diagnostic language without consent
- Western-centric interpretations

### **5. STORYTELLER REVIEW & APPROVAL**
```
AI Analysis ‚Üí Storyteller Review ‚Üí Edits/Corrections ‚Üí Final Approval
```
- **Full control**: Storyteller can edit, reject, or request changes
- **No pressure**: Staff trained in consent-based conversations
- **Multiple rounds**: Can revise until storyteller is satisfied
- **Withdrawal option**: Can revoke consent at any time

### **6. SUPABASE STORAGE** 
```
Approved Analysis ‚Üí Encrypted Storage ‚Üí Privacy Controls ‚Üí Community Sharing (if consented)
```

**What Gets Stored:**
- **Themes**: 3-5 resilience-based life themes
- **Quotes**: 5-8 meaningful quotes (only if consent given)
- **Biography**: Strengths-based life summary
- **Connections**: Potential community connections (only if consent given)
- **Quality Metrics**: All bias detection and quality scores

### **7. COMMUNITY CONNECTION (Optional)**
```
Analysis ‚Üí Connection Algorithm ‚Üí Mutual Consent ‚Üí Facilitated Introduction
```
- **Algorithm**: Matches based on shared resilience themes, not trauma
- **Mutual consent**: Both parties must agree to connection
- **Facilitated**: Staff support initial introductions
- **Ongoing choice**: Can disconnect at any time
