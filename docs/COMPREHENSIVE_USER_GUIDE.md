## Getting Started

### What is Empathy Ledger?

Empathy Ledger is a community knowledge sovereignty platform where storytellers own their narratives, receive insights about their wisdom, and benefit when their stories create value. Built on Indigenous data sovereignty principles, it bridges ancient wisdom with emerging technology.

### Core Philosophy

- **Stories are living entities** that belong to their tellers
- **Privacy is a fundamental right**, not a feature
- **Value should flow back** to those who create it
- **Community knowledge** deserves protection and respect
- **Technology should serve** human connection, not exploit it

### Key Differentiators

- **Privacy-first design** with granular controls
- **Value distribution system** compensating storytellers
- **Policy influence tracking** showing real-world impact
- **Indigenous data sovereignty** principles throughout
- **Comprehensive analytics** while protecting individual privacy
