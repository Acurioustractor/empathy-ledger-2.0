# 🎯 TRANSCRIPT vs STORY ARCHITECTURE
## Getting the Data Flow Right

---

## 📋 **CLEAR DEFINITIONS**

### **📝 TRANSCRIPTS**
- **Raw material** from storyteller interviews, recordings, written submissions
- **Content for AI analysis** - themes, quotes, insights extracted from here
- **Private by default** - highest privacy protection
- **Source of truth** for storyteller's actual words and wisdom
- **One transcript per storyteller** (can be updated/appended)

### **📖 STORIES** 
- **Polished, shareable content** created FROM transcripts
- **Blog posts, videos, articles** - public-facing materials
- **Multiple stories per storyteller** possible
- **Derived content** - transformed transcript into engaging format
- **Storyteller-approved** for sharing and publication

## 🔄 **CORRECT DATA FLOW**

```

    TRANSCRIPT (raw content)
        ↓
    AI ANALYSIS (themes, quotes, insights)
        ↓
    STORYTELLER REVIEW & APPROVAL
        ↓
    STORY CREATION (blog post, video, article)

```

## 🏗️ **DATABASE ARCHITECTURE**

### **Core Tables:**
1. **`storytellers`** - People and their profiles
2. **`transcripts`** - Raw interview content (AI analysis source)
3. **`storyteller_ai_analysis`** - AI-generated insights FROM transcripts
4. **`stories`** - Polished content created FROM transcripts
5. **`story_themes`**, **`story_quotes`** - Extracted FROM transcripts

### **Key Relationships:**
```sql
storytellers (1) → transcripts (1) → ai_analysis (1)
storytellers (1) → stories (many) - derived content
transcripts (1) → themes (many) - AI extracted
transcripts (1) → quotes (many) - AI extracted
```

## 📊 **CURRENT AIRTABLE → SUPABASE MAPPING**

### **Airtable Structure:**
- **Storytellers table**: 100 records with profiles
- **Stories table**: 48 records with story content
- **Media table**: Links storytellers to their story content

### **What We Need:**
1. **Complete transcript migration** - Get ALL 48 story transcripts
2. **Proper story creation** - Turn transcripts into shareable stories
3. **AI analysis setup** - Process transcripts (not stories) for insights
4. **Clear separation** - Transcripts = analysis source, Stories = publication

---

## 🎯 **CORRECTED MIGRATION PLAN**

### **PHASE 1: Transcript Migration (Priority)**
```
Airtable Stories → Supabase Transcripts Table
- Story Transcript field → transcript_content
- Raw content for AI analysis
- Highest privacy protection
```

### **PHASE 2: Story Creation**
```
Airtable Stories → Supabase Stories Table  
- Create publishable stories FROM transcripts
- Include video links, images, formatted content
- Multiple stories can come from one transcript
```

### **PHASE 3: AI Analysis**
```
Supabase Transcripts → AI Analysis → Themes/Quotes
- Process transcript content (not story content)
- Extract themes, quotes, insights
- Store with storyteller approval workflow
```

## 🚨 **URGENT: Missing 26 Stories**

**Current State:**
- Airtable: 48 stories 
- Supabase: 22 stories
- **MISSING: 26 stories need migration**

**Root Cause:** Previous migration didn't capture all Airtable stories

**Solution:** Complete migration script to fetch ALL 48 stories properly

---

## ✅ **NEXT STEPS**

1. **Fix Missing Stories**: Migrate all 48 Airtable stories to Supabase
2. **Create Transcripts Table**: Separate table for AI analysis source material
3. **Update Schema**: Ensure clear transcript vs story separation
4. **AI Analysis Fix**: Process transcripts, not stories, for insights
5. **Migration Script**: Complete data transfer with proper mapping

This architecture ensures:
- **Transcripts** = AI analysis source (private, raw content)
- **Stories** = Publication content (shareable, polished)
- **Clear data flow** from interview → transcript → analysis → story
- **Storyteller control** at every step
