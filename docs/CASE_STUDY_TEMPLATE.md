## Example Case Study: Brisbane Youth Mental Health Initiative

### Executive Summary

When Brisbane's youth mental health services struggled to understand why young people weren't accessing support, Empathy Ledger helped collect 150+ anonymous stories from 16-25 year-olds. The network analysis revealed that stigma wasn't the main barrierâ€”it was the mismatch between service hours and youth schedules. This insight led to extended hours and 24/7 chat support, increasing youth engagement by 40% in six months.

### The Challenge

**Context**: Brisbane's northern suburbs experienced a 30% increase in youth mental health presentations at emergency departments between 2019-2023, despite having multiple funded services.

**Problem**: Young people weren't accessing preventive services, leading to crisis presentations. Traditional surveys yielded low response rates and surface-level insights.

**Traditional Approaches**: 
- Paper surveys at schools (12% response rate)
- Focus groups (same voices repeatedly)
- Service provider assumptions

**Opportunity**: Young people wanted to share experiences but needed a safe, anonymous, accessible platform.

### The Approach

**Stakeholder Engagement**:
1. Partnered with 3 youth organizations
2. Co-designed collection methods with youth advisors
3. Obtained ethics approval from Queensland Health
4. Built trust through community events

**Story Collection Method**:
- Mobile-first web interface
- Voice note option for low-literacy participants  
- Instagram Story-style prompts
- QR codes at youth spaces

**Privacy Safeguards**:
- No identifying information collected
- Local data storage in Australia
- Youth could delete stories anytime
- Clear consent process in plain language

**Timeline**:
- Month 1: Community engagement and co-design
- Month 2: Platform customization and testing
- Months 3-4: Story collection campaign
- Month 5: Analysis and insight generation
- Month 6: Implementation of changes

### The Stories

**Participant Demographics**:
- 156 stories collected
- Age: 16-25 (median 19)
- Gender: 58% female, 35% male, 7% non-binary
- Location: Across 15 suburbs
- Languages: 12 different home languages

**Story Themes**:
1. **Access Barriers** (45%): Timing, transport, cost
2. **Trust Issues** (30%): Fear of parents finding out, cultural stigma
3. **Service Experience** (25%): Feeling unheard, clinical environments

**Powerful Quotes**:
> "I can't miss work for a 2pm appointment. I need help at 7pm when the darkness comes."

> "The waiting room felt like a hospital. I needed somewhere that felt safe, like a friend's place."

> "They kept asking about diagnosis. I just wanted someone to understand what I was going through."

**Unexpected Insights**:
- Evening loneliness was a critical timepoint
- Cultural interpreters needed, not just language
- Peer support more trusted than professionals

### The Network Effect

**Connections Found**:
- Strong clustering by cultural background
- Time-of-day patterns across all demographics
- Shared experiences despite different suburbs

**Pattern Recognition**:
- 7-10pm identified as critical support window
- Informal spaces preferred over clinical
- Peer stories reduced isolation
