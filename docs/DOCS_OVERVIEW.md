## 🌟 **THE VISION IN ACTION**

Every document in this system serves the core mission:

> **Building technology that serves communities rather than extracting from them, where stories are sacred, storytellers retain sovereignty, and collective wisdom drives positive change.**

When you read these documents, you're not just learning about a platform - you're understanding a new way of building technology that honors Indigenous wisdom, empowers communities, and creates systems worthy of the trust communities place in them.

---

*This documentation system evolves with our understanding. As communities teach us better ways to serve their needs, these documents will grow to reflect that wisdom. The technology serves the philosophy, the philosophy serves the communities, and the communities guide us toward more just and empowering futures.*
