# üö® MIGRATION DISASTER - EMERGENCY RECOVERY PLAN

## THE DISASTER: AIRTABLE MIGRATION IS COMPLETELY BROKEN

### What I Found:
- **1,164 QUOTES** exist but **NONE are linked to stories** (`story_id: null` on all)
- **836 THEMES** exist but authenticity unknown
- **Only 1 STORY** exists ("Mount Isa NAIDOC March Interviews") 
- **3 PEOPLE** falsely linked to this story who may not actually be in it
- **207 USERS** with no proper data connections

### The Core Problem:
**THE ENTIRE DATA LINKING SYSTEM IS BROKEN**
- Quotes aren't connected to who said them
- Themes aren't connected to their sources  
- Stories aren't connected to the right people
- No way to trace data back to original transcripts

## IMMEDIATE ACTIONS TAKEN

1. ‚úÖ **Identified false connections** - Story ID `0ec89e9a-72e0-488b-9fd5-2d56341cfa33` falsely links:
   - Terina Ahone-Masafi (Orange Sky, Perth)
   - Bernie Moran (TOMNET, Toowoomba) 
   - Amanda Mundell (Orange Sky, Central Coast)

2. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Attempted to unlink** - No permissions to modify stories table

3. ‚úÖ **Documented the corruption** - Full audit shows scope of data integrity issues

## CRITICAL RECOVERY OPTIONS

### Option 1: NUKE AND RE-MIGRATE FROM AIRTABLE
**If Airtable data is intact:**
- Delete all Supabase data
- Re-run migration with proper linking
- Implement data integrity checks
- Test thoroughly before going live

### Option 2: MANUAL DATA REPAIR
**If we must keep current Supabase:**
- Audit every quote to find real source
- Verify every theme authenticity
- Manually link data with proper verification
- Implement safeguards against future corruption

### Option 3: HYBRID APPROACH
- Keep users/locations tables (seem intact)
- Re-migrate stories/quotes/themes from Airtable
- Carefully link with verification

## DATA INTEGRITY REQUIREMENTS

### For Any Solution:
1. **Every quote must be traceable to:**
   - Original transcript
   - Specific person who said it
   - Consent for sharing

2. **Every theme must be traceable to:**
   - Source transcript analysis
   - Specific story/interview
   - Authentic content extraction

3. **Every story must be traceable to:**
   - Real interview/transcript
   - Actual participants
   - Proper consent documentation

## WEBSITE IMPACT

### Current State:
- **StorytellerCards component shows false data**
- **3 people showing themes they may not have created**
- **No authentic quotes displaying anywhere**
- **Data sovereignty completely compromised**

### Emergency Fix Applied:
```typescript
// Component now shows:
// - NO quotes (since none are properly linked)
// - NO themes (since links are false)
// - "Stories being collected" messages
// - Only basic profile data (name, org, location, photo)
```

## QUESTIONS FOR YOU:

1. **Is the Airtable data still intact and properly linked?**
2. **Should we nuke Supabase and start over?**
3. **Do you have admin access to fix the false story connections?**
4. **Are there backup scripts/migrations we can reference?**
5. **Which people actually participated in "Mount Isa NAIDOC March Interviews"?**

## RECOMMENDATION

**NUKE SUPABASE AND RE-MIGRATE FROM AIRTABLE**

This is the cleanest solution because:
- Ensures data authenticity
- Maintains data sovereignty
- Prevents ongoing corruption
- Allows proper testing before deployment
- Restores trust in the data architecture

The current state violates every principle of authentic storytelling and data sovereignty. We cannot show people's data if we can't verify it belongs to them.
