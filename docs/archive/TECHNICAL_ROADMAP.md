# Empathy Ledger Technical Roadmap

_Community Knowledge Sovereignty Platform Implementation Guide_

---

## Project Vision

Build a community knowledge sovereignty platform where storytellers own their narratives, receive AI-powered insights about their stories, and benefit when their stories create value. This platform transforms individual stories into collective intelligence while ensuring communities maintain control over their data.

---

## Core Architecture

### Database Schema (Supabase)

#### Users Table - Community Identity

```sql
create table users (
  id uuid primary key default gen_random_uuid(),
  email text unique not null,
  full_name text,
  community_affiliation text,
  cultural_protocols jsonb, -- stores any cultural access restrictions
  preferred_pronouns text,
  contact_preferences jsonb,
  role text default 'storyteller', -- 'storyteller', 'admin', 'researcher'
  profile_image_url text,
  created_at timestamp with time zone default now(),
  updated_at timestamp with time zone default now()
);
```

#### Stories Table - Narrative Sovereignty

```sql
create table stories (
  id uuid primary key default gen_random_uuid(),
  storyteller_id uuid references users(id) on delete cascade,
  title text,
  transcript text not null,
  audio_url text, -- if audio uploaded
  submission_method text, -- 'web', 'whatsapp', 'sms', 'voice'
  privacy_level text default 'private', -- 'private', 'community', 'public'
  consent_settings jsonb, -- granular consent for different uses
  cultural_protocols jsonb, -- any cultural restrictions
  tags text[],
  location text,
  submitted_at timestamp with time zone default now(),
  status text default 'pending', -- 'pending', 'analyzed', 'published'
  media_content jsonb -- photos, videos, documents
);
```

#### Story Analysis Table - Community-Centered Intelligence

```sql
create table story_analysis (
  id uuid primary key default gen_random_uuid(),
  story_id uuid references stories(id) on delete cascade,
  themes jsonb, -- extracted themes using community language
  community_assets jsonb, -- strengths, innovations, expertise
  cultural_considerations jsonb, -- protocol notes, sharing guidance
  key_quotes text[],
  summary text,
  impact_categories text[], -- 'health', 'justice', 'education', etc.
  empowerment_score integer, -- measures empowerment vs extraction (0-100)
  confidence_scores jsonb,
  analyzed_at timestamp with time zone default now(),
  analysis_version text default '1.0',
  community_feedback jsonb -- corrections, validations from community
);
```

#### Community Insights Table - Collective Intelligence

```sql
create table community_insights (
  id uuid primary key default gen_random_uuid(),
  community_id text, -- community identifier
  insight_type text, -- 'pattern', 'trend', 'recommendation'
  title text not null,
  description text,
  supporting_stories uuid[], -- array of story IDs
  confidence_level numeric,
  tags text[],
  visibility text default 'community', -- 'community', 'public', 'restricted'
  generated_at timestamp with time zone default now(),
  value_created jsonb -- tracking grants, policy influence, etc.
);
```

#### Value Events Table - Benefit Distribution

```sql
create table value_events (
  id uuid primary key default gen_random_uuid(),
  story_id uuid references stories(id),
  insight_id uuid references community_insights(id),
  event_type text, -- 'grant_funded', 'media_license', 'policy_influence'
  value_amount numeric,
  storyteller_share numeric,
  community_share numeric,
  description text,
  occurred_at timestamp with time zone default now(),
  distribution_status text default 'pending' -- 'pending', 'completed'
);
```

## Key Features to Build

### 1. Story Submission Interface

**Philosophy**: "Share your experience" not "Submit content"

**Features:**

- **Multi-channel input**: Web form, WhatsApp integration, SMS gateway
- **Voice-to-text**: Audio upload with automatic transcription
- **Privacy controls**: Granular consent checkboxes for different uses
- **Cultural protocols**: Options for Indigenous/culturally sensitive content
- **Mobile-first**: Accessible on any device, works offline

**Implementation:**

```jsx
function StorySubmission() {
  const [story, setStory] = useState('');
  const [consent, setConsent] = useState({
    allowAnalysis: false,
    allowCommunitySharing: false,
    allowPublicSharing: false,
    allowResearch: false,
    allowValueCreation: false,
  });
  const [culturalProtocols, setCulturalProtocols] = useState({
    seasonalRestrictions: false,
    genderSpecific: false,
    ceremonialContent: false,
    requiresElderReview: false,
  });

  // Implementation focuses on dignity and community control
}
```

### 2. AI Analysis Engine

**Philosophy**: Serve community wisdom, don't extract insights

**Analysis Framework:**

```javascript
const analysisPrompt = `
When analyzing this story, remember:

1. LANGUAGE PRESERVATION: Use the storyteller's exact words and phrases
2. STRENGTH-FIRST: Identify assets, innovations, and expertise before challenges
3. CULTURAL RESPECT: Note any cultural elements that may require special protocols
4. NON-EXTRACTIVE FRAMING: Frame insights as "This story confirms community wisdom"
5. COMMUNITY SOVEREIGNTY: This analysis belongs to the storyteller and their community

Story: ${transcript}

Provide analysis in this structure:
{
  "themes": ["using storyteller's language"],
  "community_assets": {
    "strengths_mentioned": [],
    "innovations_described": [],
    "expertise_demonstrated": [],
    "support_systems": []
  },
  "cultural_considerations": {
    "protocols_noted": [],
    "sharing_guidance": "",
    "seasonal_restrictions": false
  },
  "summary": "2-sentence summary that demonstrates rather than reveals",
  "empowerment_score": 85
}
`;
```

### 3. Community Intelligence Dashboard

- **Pattern Recognition**: Cross-story analysis showing community-wide themes
- **Trend Identification**: Changes in story themes over time
- **Collective Insights**: What multiple stories reveal about systemic issues
- **Evidence Generation**: Data for grant applications, advocacy
- **Community Sovereignty**: Full control over who sees aggregated insights

### 4. Value Tracking & Distribution

**Philosophy**: Communities benefit from their knowledge

**Features:**

- **Value Events**: Track when stories influence grants, policy, media
- **Automatic Distribution**: Smart contracts for revenue sharing
- **Community Funds**: Collective investment in community projects
- **Recognition System**: Storytellers receive appropriate credit
