## üéØ Development Principles

### 1. **Community First**
Every technical decision must serve community empowerment and data sovereignty.

### 2. **Privacy by Default**
All data starts private with explicit consent required for sharing.

### 3. **Cultural Sensitivity**
Indigenous protocols and community-specific guidelines are embedded in code.

### 4. **Value Return**
Benefits generated from community data must flow back to those communities.

### 5. **Transparent Development**
Clear documentation and open processes for community accountability.
