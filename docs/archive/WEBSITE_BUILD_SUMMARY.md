# Empathy Ledger Website Build Summary

## Overview

We've successfully built a trust-first website for Empathy Ledger that balances a sleek, minimal aesthetic with warmth and authenticity. The implementation focuses on clearly explaining the platform while building trust through design patterns inspired by respected Australian organizations like CSIRO, Beyond Blue, and Red Cross.

- **Trust-First Components**: Security badges, privacy toggles, trust bars
- **Color Palette**:
  - Primary blues for trust and stability
  - Teal for empathy and connection
  - Coral for human warmth
  - Warm grays for content

### 2. **Core Components** (`/src/components/`)

#### Trust Components
