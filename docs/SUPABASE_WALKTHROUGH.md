# Empathy Ledger: Supabase Implementation Walkthrough

*Step-by-step guide to test and validate the complete platform*

---

## üöÄ **PHASE 1: Supabase Project Setup & Validation**

### Step 1: Access Your Supabase Dashboard

1. **Go to [supabase.com/dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard)**
2. **Sign in** to your account
3. **Find your Empathy Ledger project**
4. **Check project status** - if paused, click "Restart Project"

### Step 2: Verify Database Structure

**Go to Table Editor** and confirm these tables exist:

#### Core Tables ‚úÖ
- [ ] `profiles` - User profiles and settings
- [ ] `stories` - Story content and metadata  
- [ ] `communities` - Community definitions
- [ ] `community_members` - User-community relationships
- [ ] `organizations` - Organization data

#### Privacy Tables ‚úÖ
- [ ] `consent_records` - User consent tracking
- [ ] `audit_logs` - Privacy action logging
- [ ] `data_export_requests` - GDPR export requests
- [ ] `deletion_requests` - Account deletion requests

#### Analytics Tables ‚úÖ
- [ ] `organization_insights` - Cached analytics data
- [ ] `value_transactions` - Compensation tracking
- [ ] `policy_impacts` - Policy influence records

### Step 3: Test Database Functions

**Go to SQL Editor** and run these tests:

```sql
-- Test 1: Check if RLS is enabled
SELECT schemaname, tablename, rowsecurity 
FROM pg_tables 
WHERE schemaname = 'public' 
  AND rowsecurity = true;

-- Test 2: Verify functions exist
SELECT routine_name, routine_type 
FROM information_schema.routines 
WHERE routine_schema = 'public' 
  AND routine_name LIKE '%privacy%' 
  OR routine_name LIKE '%consent%';

-- Test 3: Check indexes for performance
SELECT indexname, tablename 
FROM pg_indexes 
WHERE schemaname = 'public' 
ORDER BY tablename;
```

### Step 4: Configure Storage

**Go to Storage** and verify:

1. **Create 'media' bucket** if it doesn't exist
2. **Set bucket to public** for published content
3. **Configure upload policies**:

```sql
-- Allow authenticated users to upload
CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can upload" ON storage.objects
FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (auth.role() = 'authenticated');

-- Allow public read access
CREATE POLICY "Public read access" ON storage.objects
FOR SELECT USING (bucket_id = 'media');
```

---

## üß™ **PHASE 2: Create Test Data Environment**

### Step 1: Create Test Organization

```sql
INSERT INTO organizations (
  id,
  name,
  slug,
  description,
  website,
  contact_email,
  is_active
) VALUES (
  gen_random_uuid(),
  'Melbourne Community Network',
  'melbourne-community',
  'Supporting diverse communities across Melbourne through storytelling and advocacy',
  'https://melbournecommunity.org.au',
  'stories@melbournecommunity.org.au',
  true
) RETURNING id;
-- Save this ID for later use
```

### Step 2: Create Test Community

```sql
INSERT INTO communities (
  id,
  organization_id,
  name,
  slug,
  description,
  privacy_level,
  membership_type,
  member_count,
  story_count,
  is_active
) VALUES (
  gen_random_uuid(),
  '[organization-id-from-above]', -- Replace with actual ID
  'Inner Melbourne Families',
  'inner-melbourne-families',
  'A safe space for families in inner Melbourne to share experiences and support each other',
  'public',
  'open',
  0,
  0,
  true
) RETURNING id;
-- Save this ID for later use
```

### Step 3: Create Test User Profile

We'll create this through the application, but here's the SQL for reference:

```sql
-- This will be created when user signs up through the app
-- But you can check the structure:
SELECT column_name, data_type, is_nullable 
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name = 'profiles';
```

## üë§ **PHASE 3: Complete User Journey Test**

### Step 1: User Registration & Onboarding

**Test Scenario: Sarah Thompson, Community Worker**

1. **Open your application** in browser (http://localhost:3000)
2. **Navigate to Sign Up** 
3. **Create account with:**
   - Email: `sarah.thompson.test@gmail.com`
   - Password: `CommunityStories2024!`
   - Full Name: `Sarah Thompson`
   - Display Name: `Sarah T.`
   - Age Range: `35-44`
   - Location: `Melbourne, VIC`
   - Role: `storyteller`

4. **Complete privacy preferences:**
   - ‚úÖ Data collection & processing
   - ‚úÖ AI-powered insights  
   - ‚ùå Research participation (initially)
   - ‚úÖ Story sharing
   - ‚ùå Platform updates

### Step 2: First Story Submission

**Story Content to Test:**

```
Title: "Finding Community Support During Crisis"

Content: "Last year, when my family faced an unexpected financial crisis, I discovered the incredible power of community support networks in inner Melbourne. 

What started as a desperate search for emergency assistance became a journey of connection, resilience, and hope. Through our local community center, I met other parents facing similar challenges. We formed an informal support group that became a lifeline.

The practical help was immediate - shared meals, childcare swaps, and information about resources I didn't know existed. But the emotional support was transformative. Knowing I wasn't alone in struggling to balance work, parenting, and financial pressures made all the difference.

Six months later, I'm not just receiving support - I'm actively giving it. I've learned that community strength comes from everyone contributing what they can, when they can. My professional background in social work has become valuable in helping others navigate support systems.

This experience taught me that asking for help isn't a sign of weakness - it's how communities grow stronger together. The relationships we've built continue to enrich all our lives, long after the original crisis passed.

I hope sharing this story encourages others to reach out when they need support, and to offer help when they're able. Strong communities are built one connection at a time."

SELECT 
  s.id,
  p.id,
  'Thank you for sharing this. Your story gives me hope as someone going through a similar situation.',
  false
FROM stories s, profiles p
WHERE s.title LIKE '%Community Support%'
  AND p.email = 'community.member.test@gmail.com';

-- Update engagement counts
UPDATE stories 
SET 
  view_count = 45,
  reaction_count = reaction_count + 1,

-- This should return community stories for community members
SELECT s.title, s.privacy_level 
FROM stories s
JOIN community_members cm ON s.community_id = cm.community_id
WHERE cm.user_id = (SELECT id FROM profiles WHERE email = 'community.member.test@gmail.com');
```

---

## üéØ **PHASE 7: Relationship & Connection Mapping**

### Step 1: Create Story Connections

**Add more stories and users to test relationships:**

```sql
-- Create related story from another user
INSERT INTO stories (
  id,
  title,
  content,
  category,
  themes,
  privacy_level,
  contributor_id,
  community_id,
  status
) VALUES (
  gen_random_uuid(),
  'Building Support Networks for New Parents',
  'As a new parent in Melbourne, I was overwhelmed until I found the local parent group...',
  'community',
  ARRAY['parenting', 'community support', 'social connection'],
  'public',
  (SELECT id FROM profiles WHERE email = 'community.member.test@gmail.com'),
  (SELECT id FROM communities WHERE slug = 'inner-melbourne-families'),
  'approved'
);
```

### Step 2: Test Theme Connections

**Verify related stories appear:**

  array_length(array(SELECT unnest(s1.themes) INTERSECT SELECT unnest(s2.themes)), 1) as shared_themes
FROM stories s1, stories s2
WHERE s1.id != s2.id
  AND s1.themes && s2.themes  -- Arrays overlap
ORDER BY shared_themes DESC;
```

### Step 3: Test Community Connections

1. **View Sarah's profile** (if allowed by privacy)
2. **See community memberships**

FROM pg_statio_user_indexes;
```

---

## üõ°Ô∏è **PHASE 9: Security & Privacy Validation**

### Step 1: Test Row Level Security

**Verify users can only see permitted data:**

```sql
-- Test as Sarah (should see her own stories)
SET session.user_id = (SELECT id FROM profiles WHERE email = 'sarah.thompson.test@gmail.com');
SELECT title FROM stories; -- Should see own + public stories

-- Test access to other user's private data (should fail)
SELECT privacy_settings FROM profiles WHERE email != 'sarah.thompson.test@gmail.com';
```

### Step 2: Test Audit Logging

**Verify all actions are logged:**

```sql
-- Check recent privacy actions
SELECT 
  user_id,
  action,
  resource_type,
  timestamp
FROM audit_logs 
WHERE timestamp > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 day'
ORDER BY timestamp DESC;
```

### Step 3: Test Data Deletion

1. **Create test user:** `delete.test@gmail.com`
2. **Submit a story**
3. **Request account deletion**
4. **Verify anonymization works:**

```sql
-- Check user was anonymized
SELECT email, display_name, anonymized_at 
FROM profiles 
WHERE email LIKE 'anonymized_%@empathyledger.local';

-- Check story was anonymized but preserved
SELECT title, content, anonymized_at 
FROM stories 
WHERE anonymized_at IS NOT NULL;
```

---

## üìà **PHASE 10: Success Metrics Validation**

### Step 1: Analytics Accuracy

**Verify metrics are calculated correctly:**

```sql
-- Check story metrics
SELECT 
  COUNT(*) as total_stories,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE status = 'approved') as published_stories,
  AVG(view_count) as avg_views,
  AVG(reaction_count) as avg_reactions
FROM stories;

-- Check user engagement
SELECT 
  COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) as active_users,
  COUNT(*) as total_reactions
FROM story_reactions 
WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days';
```

### Step 2: Value Distribution Accuracy

```sql
-- Check value calculations
SELECT 
  transaction_type,
  SUM(amount_cents) as total_cents,
  COUNT(*) as transaction_count,
  AVG(amount_cents) as avg_compensation
FROM value_transactions 
WHERE status = 'completed'
GROUP BY transaction_type;
```

### Step 3: Privacy Compliance Check

```sql
-- Ensure all users have consent records
SELECT 
  p.email,
  COUNT(cr.id) as consent_records
FROM profiles p
LEFT JOIN consent_records cr ON p.id = cr.user_id
GROUP BY p.email
HAVING COUNT(cr.id) = 0; -- Should return no results

-- Check data retention compliance
SELECT 
  COUNT(*) as users_requesting_deletion,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE deletion_requested_at < NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days') as overdue_deletions
FROM profiles 
WHERE deletion_requested_at IS NOT NULL;
```
