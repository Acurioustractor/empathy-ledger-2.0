### **Primary Organization Outreach Email**

**Subject:** "Alternative to LinkedIn for Finding Professionals with Authentic Community Relationships"

```
Dear [Organization Leadership],

I hope this message finds you well. My name is Ben Knight, and I'm writing from A Curious Tractor, where we've been building Empathy Ledger‚Äîwhat we believe will become the storytelling-centered alternative to LinkedIn.

I'm reaching out because organizations like [Organization Name] consistently face a challenge that traditional professional networking platforms can't solve: finding professionals whose expertise comes from authentic community relationships rather than just credentials.

When you're looking for [specific role type - program managers, community organizers, consultants], traditional platforms show you job titles and skills lists, but they can't tell you who has actually earned community trust, understands cultural protocols, or approaches their work with genuine commitment to community empowerment rather than career advancement.

**The Problem:**
Traditional hiring processes miss professionals whose most valuable qualifications can't be captured in resumes:
- Cultural competency developed through authentic community relationships
- Trust-building skills proven through long-term community engagement
- Understanding of power dynamics and commitment to equitable partnership
- Experience with community-led approaches and participatory decision-making

**Our Solution:**
Empathy Ledger enables professionals to share their expertise through storytelling rather than resume optimization. Stories reveal how someone actually approaches their work, what values guide their professional choices, and how their experience has developed through authentic community engagement.

**For Organizations Like Yours:**
- **Discover professionals** whose expertise comes from authentic community relationship building
- **Understand values and approach** through stories rather than credentials
- **Test compatibility** through our three-tier system before major commitments
- **Support professional development** for community-centered workers through revenue sharing

**Example Impact:**
Rather than hiring a "Community Engagement Coordinator with 5 years experience," you could connect with someone whose story demonstrates how they learned cultural protocols from Aboriginal communities, built trust with young people in the justice system, and developed community-led programming that actually empowers rather than extracts.

**Next Steps:**
We're currently working with a select group of early adopter organizations to test how storytelling-centered talent discovery creates better hiring and partnership outcomes.

Would you be interested in a 20-minute conversation about how storytelling-centered networking might serve [Organization Name]'s talent needs while supporting the professional development of community-centered workers?

You can learn more about our community-centered approach at [A Curious Tractor website] and see example storyteller profiles at [Empathy Ledger demo].

**We believe professional networking should strengthen communities rather than fragmenting them into individual competitive relationships. Organizations like [Organization Name] are building the future where authentic community engagement is recognized and valued appropriately.**

Looking forward to the possibility of collaboration,

Ben Knight

### **Foundation-Specific Email Template**

**Subject:** "Finding Grantee Partners with Authentic Community Relationships vs. Strong Grant Applications"

```
Dear [Foundation Program Officer],

I'm writing from A Curious Tractor about a challenge that many foundations face: traditional grantmaking processes excel at identifying organizations with strong grant-writing capabilities, but they're less effective at identifying partners with authentic community relationships and genuine community accountability.

Empathy Ledger addresses this gap by enabling community organizations and professionals to demonstrate their expertise through storytelling rather than grant application optimization.

**For Foundations:**
- **Discover potential grantees** whose expertise comes from authentic community engagement rather than development office sophistication
- **Understand organizational approach** through stories about community relationships and empowerment outcomes
- **Assess cultural competency and community accountability** through narrative rather than abstract organizational descriptions
- **Support community-controlled resource distribution** through professionals who understand participatory grantmaking

**Example Value:**
Rather than selecting grantees based primarily on grant application quality, you could identify community organizations whose stories demonstrate authentic community leadership, cultural competency, and commitment to empowerment rather than service delivery.

Would you be interested in exploring how storytelling-centered grantee discovery might support [Foundation Name]'s community empowerment and equity goals?

Best regards,
Ben Knight

### **Healthcare Organization Email Template**

**Subject:** "Finding Community Health Professionals with Cultural Competency vs. Clinical Credentials"

```
Dear [Healthcare Organization Leadership],

I'm reaching out from A Curious Tractor about a challenge many healthcare organizations face: traditional hiring processes excel at identifying professionals with clinical credentials, but they're less effective at finding practitioners with authentic community relationships and cultural competency.

This gap becomes critical when serving diverse communities where trust, cultural understanding, and authentic relationship building are as important as clinical expertise.

**For Healthcare Organizations:**
- **Discover practitioners** whose expertise includes cultural competency developed through authentic community engagement
- **Understand patient/community approach** through stories rather than clinical credentials alone
- **Assess trauma-informed and culturally responsive capabilities** through narrative demonstration
- **Support community health worker professional development** through revenue sharing and recognition

**Example Value:**
Rather than hiring "Community Health Worker with relevant experience," you could connect with someone whose story demonstrates how they've built trust with specific communities, navigated cultural protocols respectfully, and approached health equity through community empowerment rather than clinical intervention alone.

Would you be interested in discussing how storytelling-centered talent discovery might support [Organization Name]'s community engagement and health equity goals?

Best regards,
Ben Knight
