**Subject:** "Invitation: $1000 to Build Your Story on Platform Designed with Indigenous Data Sovereignty"

```
Dear Justice AI Governance Team,

I hope this message finds you well. My name is Ben Knight, and I'm reaching out from A Curious Tractor, where we've been building Empathy Ledgerâ€”what we believe will become the storytelling-centered alternative to LinkedIn.

Your work on community-accountable AI governance and decolonial operating systems represents exactly the kind of ethical technology expertise that traditional professional platforms often fail to recognize or compensate appropriately. More importantly, your commitment to Indigenous data sovereignty aligns perfectly with the foundational principles we've built into Empathy Ledger.

We're launching a $1000 Storyteller Program to work with 10 exceptional community leaders like yourselves to develop world-class professional profiles that demonstrate how storytelling creates more authentic and empowering professional relationships than traditional resume-based networking.

**Why We're Reaching Out:**
Your expertise in community-accountable AI and Indigenous data sovereignty represents precisely the kind of knowledge that traditional platforms extract without compensation or community control. We've built Empathy Ledger with Aboriginal cultural protocols from the ground up, including:

- **Data Sovereignty:** Storytellers own their content completely and control who accesses it
- **Community Governance:** Platform policies include meaningful community participation rather than top-down corporate control
- **Revenue Sharing:** 70% of subscription revenue flows to storytellers, not platform shareholders
- **Cultural Protocols:** Design informed by Aboriginal relationship-building wisdom and respectful engagement practices

**What We're Offering:**
- $1000 to support your profile development and storytelling
- Complete content creation support including professional story development and visual assets
- Three-tier revenue system where you earn income from your expertise ($25/month subscriptions + organizational consultation opportunities)
- Platform designed with the ethical technology principles you advocate for
- Community of practice with other Indigenous technologists and community-centered professionals

**Your Potential Impact:**
A Justice AI member's storyteller profile would demonstrate how ethical technology expertise can be shared and compensated through community-controlled platforms rather than being extracted by corporate networks. Your story about developing community-accountable AI governance would show exactly why technical expertise informed by Indigenous wisdom creates better outcomes than traditional tech development.

This aligns directly with your decolonial operating system workâ€”proving that technology can amplify Indigenous knowledge rather than extracting from it.

**Next Steps:**
If this resonates with your vision for ethical technology and Indigenous data sovereignty, I'd love to schedule a 30-minute conversation to share more about the platform and explore whether this program might serve your professional goals while advancing community-controlled technology development.

You can learn more about our community-centered approach through A Curious Tractor at acurioustractor.org and see our foundational profile demo at [platform link].

**This is more than professional networkingâ€”it's about proving that technology can honor Indigenous wisdom while creating economic opportunities for the people whose knowledge creates platform value.**

Looking forward to the possibility of collaboration,

Ben Knight
Co-founder, A Curious Tractor  
Creator, Empathy Ledger

P.S. Our platform development has been guided by Aboriginal community protocols from day one, including ongoing consultation with Indigenous advisors who help ensure our implementation honors rather than appropriates cultural wisdom.

## ðŸ“§ **Email 2: First Nations Information Governance Centre**

**To:** FNIGC contact form + OCAP principles network outreach
**Subject:** "Aboriginal Data Sovereignty Meets Professional Networking: $1000 Storyteller Program Invitation"

```
Dear FNIGC Team,

Greetings. My name is Ben Knight, and I'm writing from A Curious Tractor about work that I believe aligns deeply with FNIGC's commitment to Indigenous data sovereignty and the OCAP principles.

I'm building Empathy Ledger as the storytelling-centered alternative to LinkedIn, designed specifically to address how traditional platforms extract value from Indigenous knowledge without community control or compensation.

**Connection to FNIGC's Work:**
Your leadership in establishing OCAP (Ownership, Control, Access, and Possession) principles provides the framework we've used to ensure Indigenous storytellers maintain complete control over their professional content while benefiting economically from sharing their expertise.

**Platform Design Aligned with OCAP:**
- **Ownership:** Storytellers own their content files completely, not just usage rights
- **Control:** Individual storytellers and Indigenous communities control who accesses their knowledge and under what conditions  
- **Access:** Three-tier system allows Indigenous professionals to share knowledge publicly, behind paywalls they control, or through specific organizational partnerships
- **Possession:** Content portability ensures storytellers can move their stories and professional relationships to other platforms if needed

**$1000 Storyteller Program Invitation:**
We're working with 10 community leaders to develop world-class professional profiles that demonstrate how storytelling honors Indigenous expertise while creating economic opportunities. An FNIGC team member's participation would:

- **Demonstrate Data Sovereignty in Practice:** Show how Indigenous professionals can control their knowledge sharing and benefit economically
- **Advance Indigenous Technology Leadership:** Prove that platforms can be designed with Indigenous protocols from the foundation
- **Create Economic Opportunities:** Generate income through expertise sharing while maintaining community accountability
- **Build Indigenous Professional Networks:** Connect with other Indigenous leaders building community-controlled economic relationships

**What We're Offering:**
- $1000 to support profile development and storytelling
- Complete content creation support respecting Indigenous knowledge protocols
- Revenue sharing (70% to storytellers) from professional networking and consultation opportunities
- Platform governance that includes Indigenous community representation
- Technical architecture designed to prevent knowledge extraction and ensure community benefit

**Why This Matters:**
Traditional professional platforms treat Indigenous expertise as individual credentials rather than community knowledge that requires protocols and compensation. Your story about developing FNIGC and advancing Indigenous data sovereignty would demonstrate how professional networking can honor Indigenous knowledge systems while creating opportunities for Indigenous technologists and community leaders.

**Next Steps:**
Would someone from FNIGC be interested in a conversation about how storytelling-centered networking might serve Indigenous professional development while advancing data sovereignty principles?

You can learn more about our community-centered approach at acurioustractor.org and our foundational Aboriginal community engagement at [community protocols documentation].

**We believe professional networking should strengthen Indigenous communities rather than extracting knowledge for corporate benefit.**

Miigwech for your consideration,

Ben Knight
Co-founder, A Curious Tractor
Creator, Empathy Ledger

P.S. All platform development includes ongoing consultation with Aboriginal community advisors who ensure our approach honors Indigenous protocols and creates genuine community benefit.

## ðŸ“§ **Email 3: BEAM Collective**

**To:** Contact form at beam.community + social media connection
**Subject:** "Community-Owned Platform for Black Wellness Expertise: $1000 Storyteller Program"

```
Dear BEAM Collective,

I hope this message finds you in community and wellness. My name is Ben Knight, and I'm reaching out from A Curious Tractor about work that I believe aligns with BEAM's commitment to Black emotional and mental health empowerment.

Your development of healing-centered approaches for Black communities represents exactly the kind of expertise that traditional professional platforms consistently undervalueâ€”community wellness knowledge that doesn't fit standard clinical credentials but creates profound healing and empowerment.

**Why We're Reaching Out:**
We're building Empathy Ledger as the storytelling-centered alternative to LinkedIn, designed specifically for professionals whose expertise comes from authentic community relationships rather than traditional credentialing. BEAM's approach to community-controlled healing perfectly embodies what we hope to support and amplify.

**Platform Alignment with BEAM Values:**
- **Community Ownership:** Platform governance includes community participation rather than corporate control
- **Economic Justice:** 70% of revenue flows to content creators (storytellers) rather than being extracted by platform owners
- **Healing-Centered:** Designed to strengthen communities rather than fragment them into individual competitive relationships
- **Cultural Competency:** Built with protocols that respect diverse approaches to wellness and community empowerment

**$1000 Storyteller Program Invitation:**
We're working with 10 exceptional community leaders to develop world-class professional profiles that demonstrate how storytelling creates more authentic professional relationships than resume optimization. A BEAM member's participation would:

- **Demonstrate Alternative Wellness Expertise:** Show how community-based healing approaches deserve professional recognition and compensation
- **Advance Black Wellness Leadership:** Connect with networks that value community healing over clinical extraction
- **Create Economic Opportunities:** Generate income from wellness expertise while maintaining community accountability
- **Build Healing Networks:** Connect with other healing-centered professionals building alternative economic relationships

**What We're Offering:**
- $1000 to support your profile development and storytelling
- Complete content creation support honoring healing-centered approaches
- Three-tier revenue system where you control access to your wellness expertise and earn 70% of subscription revenue
- Platform designed to prevent extraction and ensure community benefit
- Community of practice with other Black wellness leaders and community-centered professionals

**Your Potential Impact:**
A BEAM member's storyteller profile would demonstrate how Black wellness expertiseâ€”cultural competency, trauma-informed healing, community accountabilityâ€”creates more effective outcomes than traditional clinical approaches. Your story about building BEAM's community-controlled healing would show exactly why wellness networks should be owned by communities rather than healthcare corporations.

**Next Steps:**
If this resonates with BEAM's vision for community-controlled healing and Black wellness empowerment, I'd love to schedule a 30-minute conversation to explore how this platform might serve your professional goals while advancing community ownership of healing resources.

You can learn more about our community-centered approach at acurioustractor.org and our commitment to community protocols at [Aboriginal community engagement documentation].

**This is about proving that wellness expertise deserves economic recognition while strengthening rather than extracting from Black communities.**

In community and solidarity,

Ben Knight

P.S. Our platform development is guided by community advisors who ensure we build tools that serve community empowerment rather than reproducing extractive patterns, even with good intentions.
