# 🚀 EXECUTE MIGRATION - STEP BY STEP

## ✅ MIGRATION IS READY TO EXECUTE

All scripts are prepared. Here's exactly what to do:

## STEP 1: BACKUP CURRENT DATA
```bash
# Create backup of current Supabase data
pg_dump your_database > pre_migration_backup.sql
```

## STEP 2: EXECUTE FOUNDATION (PHASE 1)
```bash
# Run the foundation setup
npx tsx scripts/execute-migration.ts
```
**This will:**
- 💥 Delete all existing tables
- 🏗️ Create new storyteller-centric schema
- 🔍 Add validation functions
- 🔒 Set up consent-based security

## STEP 3: EXECUTE DATA MIGRATION (PHASES 2-7)
```bash
# Run the complete migration
npx tsx scripts/migration-phases-3-7.ts
```
**This will:**
- 🧑 Import storytellers from Airtable (consent required)
- 📍 Import and link locations
- 📝 Import transcripts (linked to storytellers)
- 💬 Extract quotes FROM transcripts
- 🏷️ Generate themes FROM transcripts  
- 📖 Create publishable stories

## STEP 4: UPDATE WEBSITE COMPONENTS
```bash
# Test and update components
npx tsx scripts/update-website-components.ts
```
**This will:**
- 🧪 Test new architecture
- 📝 Generate new StorytellerCards component
- 🔍 Validate data integrity

## STEP 5: DEPLOY NEW COMPONENT
Replace the current StorytellerCards component with the generated one that uses the new architecture.

## WHAT YOU'LL GET

### Before Migration:
- ❌ Fake quotes made up by AI
- ❌ False connections between people and data
- ❌ No data traceability
- ❌ Orphaned quotes and themes

### After Migration:
- ✅ **Every quote traces to a real person's transcript**
- ✅ **Every theme derives from someone's actual story**
- ✅ **Only consenting storytellers displayed**
- ✅ **Complete data sovereignty**
- ✅ **Zero fabricated content**

## THE GUARANTEE

**After this migration, when someone visits your website and sees a quote, they can trace it back through:**
1. Quote → Transcript → Real Person → Consent Given

**No exceptions. No fake data. Only authentic human stories.**

## READY TO EXECUTE?

All scripts are prepared and tested. The migration will take about 1-2 hours to complete all phases.

**Type "yes" if you want to proceed with the nuclear option and rebuild everything properly.**
