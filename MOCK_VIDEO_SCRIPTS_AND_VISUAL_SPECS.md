## ðŸŽ¬ **Video Content Scripts**

### **1. Primary Video Story (10 minutes): "Building the Alternative to LinkedIn"**

**OPENING (0:00-1:30)**
```
[VISUAL: Ben in natural setting, A Curious Tractor office with community photos visible]

BEN: "What if I told you that professional networking doesn't have to feel transactional? That there's a way to build careers that strengthen communities rather than fragmenting them into individual competition?"

[VISUAL: Split screen - LinkedIn profile vs. Empathy Ledger story-based profile]

"My name is Ben Knight, and I'm building what I believe will become the world's first storytelling-centered alternative to LinkedIn. But this isn't a story about disrupting an industry for the sake of disruption. This is about honoring the wisdom I learned from Aboriginal communities, youth in the justice system, and organizations like Orange Sky and AIME about what authentic relationship building actually looks like."

```

**COMMUNITY FOUNDATION (1:30-4:00)**
```
[VISUAL: Muswellbrook landscapes, youth work photos, Aboriginal community imagery with permission]

"Growing up in Muswellbrook taught me that in small communities, you can't hide behind professional facades. People know your family, your struggles, your real story. Relationships matter more than credentials.

This foundation led me into youth work, where I learned that traditional professional boundaries often prevent the connections that actually help people transform their lives. Working with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities taught me relationship-building protocols that go far deeper than networking events or LinkedIn connections."

[VISUAL: Youth Justice project documentation, community consultation sessions]

"You don't start by talking about what you can get from the relationship. You start by understanding the community, respecting cultural protocols, listening deeply, and proving through actionsâ€”not wordsâ€”that you're there to serve rather than extract."
```

**A CURIOUS TRACTOR EVOLUTION (4:00-6:30)**
```
[VISUAL: A Curious Tractor workspace, team collaboration, Youth Justice project materials]

"Co-founding A Curious Tractor with Nicholas Marchesi became our laboratory for testing these principles at scale. Our Youth Justice project proved that the most powerful professional stories come from frontline community workers whose expertise is rarely captured in traditional networking formats.

When youth workers shared specific stories about transformation moments with young people, they connected with each other in ways that traditional networking never achieved. These weren't feel-good anecdotesâ€”they were evidence of expertise, demonstrations of approach, and invitations for collaboration."

```

**EMPATHY LEDGER VISION (6:30-8:30)**
```
[VISUAL: Empathy Ledger interface, three-tier system demonstration, revenue sharing graphics]

"That's when I realized we needed to scale these principles beyond youth justice to anyone frustrated with the superficiality of traditional professional networking. Empathy Ledger emerged from recognizing that storytelling isn't just a nice addition to professional networkingâ€”it's the only way to truly understand someone's professional value.

The platform operates on fundamentally different principles: storytellers own their content completely, benefit financially when their stories create value, and participate in governance decisions rather than being subjects of algorithmic manipulation."

```

**CALL TO ACTION (8:30-10:00)**
```
[VISUAL: Diverse storytellers, community collaborations, platform growth visualization]

"This transformation from extractive to empowering professional networking can't happen in isolation. It requires storytellers, community workers, platform builders, and organizations who are equally committed to honoring stories and amplifying community wisdom.

The future of professional networking will be built by communities, for communities, with community ownership and control. The question isn't whether this transformation will happenâ€”it's whether you want to be part of building it."
